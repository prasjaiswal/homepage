She loved being at my house, she loved being with my children.&quot;  \r\n\r\nSteinman, who was the matron of honor at Rowe&apos;s first wedding to Rick Edelman, has since lost touch with her and said that, at the time, she could not believe that Rowe gave up custody of Prince, 12, and Paris, 11, to Jackson after their 1999 divorce.\r\n&quot;The thing that was astounding to me, and I have to say this only because I loved her, is that she would give up children ... Because she loved being with my kids and one day always wanted to be a mom,&quot; Steinman told Us.\r\nIn fact, Steinman often had Rowe babysit for her.  &quot;I know from how she treated my children -- I felt totally comfortable that she would be with them whenever because she was very motherly and just had a true love for our family,&quot; she said.   When she first heard the news that Rowe wed Jackson in 1996 and was pregnant with his children, she admits she was shocked.\r\n\r\n&quot;I know that when I worked for Dr. Klein, Michael was a patient, and when he came in after hours, he would only want to see Debbie. He had very specific things. She was a nurse of Dr. Klein, and they became very good friends.&quot;  She added: &quot;I just think it progressed to a great friendship of somebody who she respected... Whatever you talk about the other side of Michael Jackson, he was a very kind, loving human being. And I can see that Debbie would react to somebody like that.&quot;\r\nAs surprising as their relationship was to her, Steinman said that if there was &quot;something he wanted her to do, I think she would&apos;ve done it for him.&quot;\r\n\r\nLast week, Rowe&apos;s attorney said that she &quot;has not reached a final decision concerning the custody proceedings,&quot; but Steinman believes Rowe would be a good parent to Jackson&apos;s older kids.  &quot;She&apos;d be a great mother to them,&quot; she told Us. &quot;I think she has all those inborn qualities of being an excellent mother. It would probably be a different upbringing than what they&apos;ve gone through. I don&apos;t even know what her wishes would be at this point.&quot;\r\nA guardianship hearing scheduled for Monday has been postponed until July 13 at the request of attorneys for Rowe and Katherine Jackson, who remains the temporary legal guardian of Prince, Paris and Blanket, 7.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Debbie Rowe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/debbie-rowe/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Katherine Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/katherine-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Friend: Debbie Rowe &#8220;Always Wanted To Be a Mom&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-07-07T13:55:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:35+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 630, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity Moms"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#respond"]}], "description": "Jane Steinman tells Us she would be an \"excellent\" parent if granted custody of Michael Jackson's children"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/", "name": "Friend: Debbie Rowe \"Always Wanted To Be a Mom\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-07T13:55:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:35+00:00", "description": "Jane Steinman tells Us she would be an \"excellent\" parent if granted custody of Michael Jackson's children", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe during a visit in France on Febraury 7, 1997.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/friend-debbie-rowe-always-wanted-to-be-a-mom-200977/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Friend: Debbie Rowe &#8220;Always Wanted To Be a Mom&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

According to reports, Debbie Rowe, the mother of the Michael&apos;s eldest children, will get visitation, but no extra money.\nThough he did not go into specifics, Katherine&apos;s attorney Londell McMillan said on CBS&apos; The Early Show Thursday: &quot;It&apos;s an agreement, an agreement for the best interests of the children. This is not a money deal. This is not about money.&quot;\nSee photos of Michael Jackson&apos;s kids through the years\nSince the singer&apos;s June 25 death, 79-year-old Katherine Jackson has remained in control of the three children, Prince, 12, Paris, 11, and Blanket, 7. Rowe has sent mixed signals on whether she wants to be the children&apos;s guardian.   \nNBC&apos;s Today show reports that under the new deal, Rowe, who will not receive any extra money, will retain her parental rights but has agreed not to claim custody.\nSee 32 photos from inside Michael Jackson&apos;s Staples Center memorial\nNBC also reports that Prince and Paris know Rowe is their mother, and as a central part of the agreement, they will begin to have a relationship with her. A child psychologist will supervise the process, according to NBC.\nAsked if the issue of custody and Rowe had been resolved, McMillan said on The Early Show, &quot;We will be making an announcement very shortly on that issue, and all of the parties are resolved. There is no situation better for these children than for them to be raised and reared in the loving care of Mrs. Katherine Jackson.&quot;  \nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years\nHe dismissed reports that Joe Jackson shouldn&apos;t be involved in raising the children. Said McMillan, &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s valid at all. I think Joe Jackson is the husband of Mrs. Jackson, but he&apos;s not living in Los Angeles.&quot;\nWhile Michael&apos;s will requested that Katherine raise his children, he appointed his two longtime business partners, John Branca and John McClain, to look after his money.  \nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nKatherine receives 40 percent of the estate, but she&apos;s fighting to be kept in the loop on all business matters.\nMcMillan denied that Katherine is trying to contest the will.\n&quot;We&apos;re not trying to rewrite the will,&quot; he said. &quot;Our concern is for anyone to have extraordinary powers, they need to have extraordinary trust and integrity.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Debbie Rowe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/debbie-rowe/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joe Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/joe-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Katherine Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/katherine-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Deal Reached: Jackson&#8217;s Mom to Get Custody of His Kids", "datePublished": "2009-07-30T12:30:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:18+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 461, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#respond"]}], "description": "Debbie Rowe will get visitation, but no extra money"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/", "name": "Deal Reached: Jackson's Mom to Get Custody of His Kids", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-30T12:30:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:18+00:00", "description": "Debbie Rowe will get visitation, but no extra money", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Jackson rowe", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deal-reached-jacksons-mom-to-get-custody-of-his-kids-2009307/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Deal Reached: Jackson&#8217;s Mom to Get Custody of His Kids"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

A final cut of the film must be screened for representatives of his estate no later than Oct. 2, must be rated PG and cannot include material that &quot;presents Michael Jackson in a negative light,&quot; according to the contract approved by L.A. Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff earlier this month.

Also in the bridal party was Tatum&apos;s sister Paige and Haylie Duff, who was accompanied by the groom&apos;s pal Nick Zano. The bridesmaids all wore light pink dresses.\nSee who else will be walking down the aisle this year.\nBeneath an altar covered in white, cream and pink roses, Dewan wore a white strapless Reem Acra dress with a sweetheart neckline and a long veil while Tatum wore a basic black suit by Giorgio Armani.  When it was time for their first kiss as husband and wife, the G.I. Joe star bent Dewan back and kissed her over his knee to cheers from the crowd, who were seated in white chairs on the lawn overlooking the ocean. The newlyweds, who exchanged Neil Lane rings, then held hands as they walked out.  Dewan, 28, and Tatum, 29, met on the set of their 2006 flick, Step Up. They were engaged last September.\nSee other celeb couples who hooked up while filming.\n&quot;They love each other so much,&quot; Dewan&apos;s father, Darryl, told Us in March. &quot;We couldn&apos;t be happier with Channing.

I&apos;ve always felt that I was his backbone, someone to be there for him. I was there and he was sort of like Moses. The things he couldn&apos;t say, I would say them.&quot;\r\n\r\nJermaine recalled the moment he found out his brother was dead -- in a devastating phone call from Katherine.\r\n&quot;She was crying, saying he was dead. To hear my mother say, &apos;Michael is dead,&apos; to feel and hear the tone in her voice to say her child is dead, is nothing that anyone can ever imagine,&quot; added Jermaine, who spoke to Matt Lauer from the Neverland Ranch.\r\n&quot;I tried to console her,&quot; he went on, &quot;but I wanted to see Michael and I wanted to see my brother. To see him there lifeless and breathless was very emotional for me. But I held myself together because I knew he&apos;s very much alive in his spirit, and that was just a shell. But I kissed him on his forehead, and I hugged him, and I touched him and I said Michael, &apos;I&apos;ll never leave you. You&apos;ll never leave me.&apos;&quot;\r\nHe also talked about watching Michael&apos;s three children say goodbye to their father as a therapist stood over them.   &quot;I know it&apos;s tough, but I think it was the best thing to do. At first I was against it, but what do you say if you don&apos;t show them?&quot; Jermaine said of the decision to have them see their dead father.\r\n\r\nJermaine said his brother was in good physical condition while rehearsing for his London concerts.  &quot;I do believe and I do know that Mike is very strong, not just mentally but physically,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s a dancer, he never stopped dancing, He was already ready physically. He passed the physical, he was strong; he was ready.&quot;\r\nBut he didn&apos;t deny reports of drug use, saying he&apos;d &quot;be hurt&quot; if they turned out to be true &quot;because Michael has always been a person who was against anything like that.   \r\n\r\n&quot;I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s right, because it&apos;s not right,&quot; Jermaine continued . &quot;But in this business, the pressure, and things that you go through -- you never know what people might turn to.&quot;\r\nJermaine says Katherine is &quot;capable&quot; of taking care of the children following a judge&apos;s decision to award her temporary custody.  &quot;She&apos;s up to it,&quot; he said. &quot;She&apos;s always with all the children, she loves laughter and the crying and all the excitement. Yes, she is.&quot;\r\nJermaine said he wanted Michael to be buried at Neverland Ranch, even though his view of his former home had changed after the child molestation trial.  \r\n\r\n&quot;He was hurt, he was torn apart, and to be treated like you&apos;re not from here, to be made a mockery for the world to see, he felt that they sort of invaded his privacy,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;A place that was so beautiful -- [to] turn it into something so ugly.&quot;\r\nOn Wednesday, a Jackson family spokesperson told Usmagazine.com no official memorial would take place at the famed estate.\r\n&quot;Contrary to previous news reports, the Jackson family is officially stating that there will be no public or private viewing at Neverland,&quot; the rep said. &quot;Plans are underway regarding a public memorial for Michael Jackson, and we will announce those plans shortly.&quot;  \r\nFor more details on Michael Jackson&apos;s shocking home life with his three children, how the kids are coping with his surprise death and never-before-seen private family photos, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jermaine Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jermaine-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jermaine Jackson Recalls Kids Last Moments With Father", "datePublished": "2009-07-02T13:39:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:35+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 848, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#respond"]}], "description": "The children said goodbye at the hospital with the help of a therapist, he says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/", "name": "Jermaine Jackson Recalls Kids Last Moments With Father", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-02T13:39:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:35+00:00", "description": "The children said goodbye at the hospital with the help of a therapist, he says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Jermaine michael b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jermaine-jackson-recalls-kids-last-moments-with-father-200927/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Jermaine Jackson Recalls Kids Last Moments With Father"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

And I just lay by her side. She wouldn&apos;t -- move on. She wouldn&apos;t pass.&quot;\r\nIn her dying moments, &quot;[Farrah] just looked at us with a slight smile,&quot; O&apos;Neal says, &quot;and then all the machines flat lined. She was gone.&quot;\r\nRemember the stars who died last year.\r\nThough O&apos;Neal was by Fawcett&apos;s side at the time of her death, the couple&apos;s 24-year-old son, Redmond, remained incarcerated for felony drug possession. He was able to attend her funeral, serving as a pall bearer, but did not get to say goodbye in person at the hospital.\r\nOf Redmond&apos;s last phone call with his mother, O&apos;Neal tells Vieira: &quot;I think it was about regret.  And the horror of not being able to see her again, and the promise of a good life -- one she would be proud of. He has a wonderful plan in mind to restore order in his life.  And he will, with my help.&quot;\r\nSee the day&apos;s top celeb news photos.\r\nIn the weeks since her passing, O&apos;Neal says he has remained upbeat -- and is touched by the outpouring of support from Fawcett&apos;s fans.  &quot;[In her final moments], I said I&apos;d see her soon, and I see her every day. I write to her in my journal,&quot; O&apos;Neal tells Vieira. &quot;Redmond says it&apos;s harder to grieve, but I told him to be patient. And when he got out, we&apos;d grieve together.&quot;\r\n&quot;I&apos;m using what she taught me to survive, to go on. I have launched into this massive job of answering the mail that has come in for her over the last few weeks,&quot; he says. &quot;Hundreds and hundreds of letters of pain and sorrow and hope.

Johansson slammed Lohan in November for being &quot;really vulgar&quot; -- 2 1/2 years after Lohan famously scrawled dirty words words about the actress on a NYC bathroom stall.  Lohan continues:  &quot;And the worst part is, in terms of what people see of me, I have become this girl who just loves to be photographed, doesn&apos;t know how to focus, doesn&apos;t know how to work on set, just loves the attention, knows how to go out at night, knows how to party.  &quot;And you know what? I was 20 years old. I never went to college,&quot; she says.\nSee photos of stars partying.\n&quot;And I lived maybe six months out of my life like that, doing something wrong, and then I stopped. God forbid I should have ever learned my lesson. But at this point it&apos;s so hard for people to even believe that there was a lesson to be learned at all, because they just think I&apos;m wrong,&quot; she adds.  The 22-year-old says Heath Ledger offered her a few words of advice before his January 2008 death from a prescription drug overdose.  &quot;I mean, it&apos;s this business. Heath Ledger once said something about this to me. He said: &apos;It&apos;s build you up to knock you down, and that&apos;s all it is. And you just have to see if you can stand through it.&apos; And it is like that, if you put yourself in this situation. I was young, so maybe I did... I always wanted to take the blame. I&apos;ve always been apologetic for other people&apos;s faults.&quot;  Lohan -- who has already been to rehab three times and gotten two DUI&apos;s -- says she &quot;didn&apos;t even try everything&quot; during her wildest phase.  &quot;I was too afraid. The one thing I tried was the wrong thing. And maybe it was just because I&apos;d seen someone else in my family do it -- not my mother. But, I don&apos;t know, it really... It sucks.&quot;  \nSee what Lindsay Lohan looks like in a bikini.\nThe actress thinks her actions would have been more acceptable if she were in a different field.  &quot;I feel like the modeling industry is a little bit more accepting of women who make mistakes. They appreciate the idea of icons.   &quot;I found that when I worked with Bert Stern on recreating the Marilyn Monroe shoot for New York magazine...When I was able to shoot with him and do that...Although I was also terrified to do it because, I mean, we&apos;re two very different people, and I was only 21.  &quot;But when I did that shoot, people didn&apos;t frown upon it. People were like, &apos;That&apos;s a bold thing to do.&apos; People looked at that shoot more than they&apos;ve looked at any film I&apos;ve done in the past four or five years.&quot;\nSee more photos of topless stars.\nLohan says she wouldn&apos;t change a thing about her life.  &quot;If I started wishing that I could have do-overs in life, then I would never have been able to really learn from my lessons. I&apos;m not necessarily grateful for certain &apos;situations&apos; in my life per se, but I am most definitely thankful that I have been able to learn from them,&quot; Lohan says.  &quot;Not to mention that I might not have had the chance to be with who I am with now if things didn&apos;t happen the way they did and when they did,&quot; she adds. Lohan was first spotted kissing Samantha Ronson at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nCheck out more photos of stars at the Cannes Film Fest!\nSo what has she learned over the years?  &quot;Stability through happiness, and comfort amongst loved ones. To overcome the fear of what tomorrow might bring,&quot; she says. &quot;And gratitude, because you have to appreciate life as it comes. It&apos;s important to be grateful for whatever it is that you have, because if you&apos;re not, you will find out that karma is a b--ch.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Lindsay Lohan", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/lindsay-lohan/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Scarlett Johansson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/scarlett-johansson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Lindsay Lohan: &#8220;I Work Just as Hard as Scarlett Johansson&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-01-08T18:55:28+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:33+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 806, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#respond"]}], "description": "\"But people get distracted by the mess I've created in my life,\" she says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/", "name": "Lindsay Lohan: \"I Work Just as Hard as Scarlett Johansson\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-01-08T18:55:28+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:33+00:00", "description": "\"But people get distracted by the mess I've created in my life,\" she says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Lohan scarlett b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lindsay-lohan-i-work-just-as-hard-as-scarlett-johansson-200981/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Lindsay Lohan: &#8220;I Work Just as Hard as Scarlett Johansson&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

However, when your designs are manufactured as part of fashion maven Diane von Furstenberg&apos;s line, it suddenly becomes a hot (and emotional!) commodity. Such was the case for the remaining designers on this week&apos;s episode of Project Runway.\r\nWhen Tim Gunn announced last night that the contestants would be designing for a fashion legend, the minds of contestants started reeling. Tanorexic Blayne could not have been more thrown by the description. His first thought? Mary-Kate Olsen, of course! &quot;I love Mary-Kate,&quot; he gushed. &quot;I wish every challenge would involve her. I want to marry Mary-Kate. Who doesn&apos;t? &quot;Well, except Tim Gunn,&quot; he quipped.  When von Furstenberg was finally revealed as the contestants&apos; client - after a trip to her New York City showroom - everyone got extremely emotional. Kenley, endearingy, was rather affected by the presence of the design diva, and was reduced to sobs as she reflected on the opportunity presented to her and the other contestants. Unlike the other designers, she revealed she had never designed for a big-name designer prior to Runway.\r\nThis week&apos;s design task? Fashion a garment in the vein of von Furstenberg&apos;s latest collection - inspired by the 1948 film Foreign Affair, starring Marlene Dietrich as a globetrotting spy. As a parting gift, each designer was given a look book of DVF&apos;s latest line, which included multicultural, layered looks. A bonus? Forget Mood Fabrics - this time the designers were given 15 minutes to find fabrics in....von Furstenberg&apos;s sample room!\r\nOnce back at Parsons, however, the fun was over, and the designers got rather snippy about each other&apos;s looks.  Terri took the first major hit, with Blayne proclaiming that he &quot;shows versatility,&#x201D; not just the same pair of pants like someone else does. &quot;Hint, hint!&quot; Joe called her a &quot;one-trick pony,&quot; with her same pant, shirt, vest/jacket combo that she does every week. But Terri wasn&apos;t the only one with critics last night: When Leann - who earned immunity last week - attempted to make small talk with Stella over her latest designs, Stella proved her disinterest, telling Terri, &quot;You&apos;re making a dress.&quot; OK, Great. I don&apos;t care.&quot;  Kenley, who could not be putting more pressure on herself, was chastised by fellow contestants and questioned by Gunn over her choice of making a dress&#x201D; and nothing else! &quot;It&apos;s very Shanghai,&quot; Gunn noted, &quot;But is it enough?&quot;  Meanwhile, Joe, with his Mandarin-style open-back top and hood, seemed &quot;overconfident,&quot; according to Leanne, who said she&apos;s &quot;surprised he&apos;s still here at this stage of the game.&quot;  Leanne seems to have first-rate judgment because she won over this week&apos;s judges (Heidi Klum, Michael Kors, Fern Mallis - who was filling in for Nina Garcia - and, of course, von Furstenberg), making this her second consecutive win. Her blue evening gown with a ruffled back and gray jacket will now be sold exclusively to American Express card owners. (not to mention the fact that she caught the eye of one of fashion&apos;s greatest!)  However, Stella was not so lucky this week.

Holmes agreed to the dance after becoming involved with the non-profit Dizzy Feet Foundation, which provides assistance to talented underprivileged youth.\r\nGet the latest Katie Holmes news\r\n&quot;It is to give scholarships to these young kids,&quot; Holmes tells ET. &quot;I think it is important to experience music and dancing and singing and the arts and sports.

On Monday&apos;s episode, Jon Gosselin suggested that he may not do the show anymore, despite Kate declaring, &quot;The show must go on.&quot;\n&quot;I don&apos;t know if the show can make that new transition,&quot; says Robert J. Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. &quot;It&apos;s like if The Cosby Show, mid-season, suddenly became Married With Children.&quot;\nSee the Gosselin family through the years\nHe says the show has already lost original fans who initially tuned in to watch &quot;this cute little show about parents changing diapers and feeding their kids.&quot;  As the couple&apos;s crumbling marriage made headlines, the show attracted a new fan base looking for drama.\nSee how the Gosselins have spent summer\nBut even those new viewers haven&apos;t stayed glued, as ratings continue to dip significantly since May&apos;s season 5 premiere, says Thompson.  And those new viewers likely &quot;aren&apos;t going to tune into a show about eight little kids for very long,&quot; he says.\nAdds Marc Berman, senior television editor at Mediaweek: &quot;Once all of this dies down and Jon and Kate aren&apos;t in the news anymore, this could be a problem for the show. They divorce, they move on with their lives and so do the viewers.&quot;  Berman cites Sonny and Cher as an example.  When they split, Cher got her own show; Sonny got his. &quot;It didn&apos;t work,&quot; Berman says. &quot;I&apos;m worried.&quot;\nSee what Kate Gosselin looked like in high school\nThompson tells Us &quot;it&apos;s possible&quot; the show could survive, but it needs to undergo several changes.   &quot;What they need to do is gather a whole new fan base,&quot; he says. &quot;People who will watch it with their tongue in their cheek. People who like to watch someone they can mock.&quot;\nSee more controversial photos of Jon and 23-year-old girlfriend Deanna Hummel\nProducers should &quot;stop this Jon storyline and make it about a single mom raising eight kids,&quot; Thompson advises. &quot;Try to go back to the spirit of the show - something you could watch with anybody in the house.&quot;\nThe problem: Who knows how Kate will behave?   &quot;The producers only have so much control,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;She could become a very complicated character to try to do a show like that. She could start dating, or start leaving the kids with the nannies.&quot;  Adds Thompson, &quot;I would not want to bet what&apos;s left of my retirement fund on the ongoing success of this show.&quot;\nUs Weekly television critic John Griffiths says Jon and Kate &quot;should throw in the towel and tend to their kids. They should have their own reality shows down the road.&quot;  &quot;The ratings have already slipped,&quot; he says. &quot;What are they going to keep do, have huge stunts all the time?&quot;\n&quot;Ultimately, I think that viewers are not just going to get tired of this, but they&apos;re going to get depressed by it,&quot; says Griffiths. &quot;People want a lot of drama in reality shows like The Real Housewives of New Jersey. But this is not about that.

Heidi is troubled by the idea.\n&quot;This is very serious. It says in the Bible this is the mark of the beast, and that is a sign of worshipping the Devil. So over my dead body would I ever get a chip in my body,&quot; she says. &quot;My body belongs to Jesus Christ. I am a disciple of Jesus, and I will speak out to Christians....this chip is the end of humanity.&quot;\nCheck out photos of religious stars\nHeidi also admits she&apos;s now &quot;very scared&quot; of birth control.\n&quot;I feel like God was telling me that this was something just created by the government that is really bad for my body, and I was just getting sick,&quot; she says. &quot;I researched it, and one of the founding people who invented birth control said it was the worst thing they had ever done, they wished they&apos;d never created it, how it morally corrupted society, it&apos;s just sickening to him. How it devalues women, how it causes depression, how it can cause cancer, how it sterilizes your body, and what it does to your body, how most women are suicidal sometimes on it.&quot;\nSpencer backs up Jones&apos; belief that 9/11 was an &quot;inside job.&quot;  &quot;From your research, it 100 percent is,&quot; Spencer says, adding later: &quot;I want to throw up.&quot;  \nRead more quotes on Jezebel.com, which first reported the story\nHe also compares The Hills to the government.  &quot;The narrator [Lauren Conrad] didn&apos;t get along with us. She skewed the information on the show, just like the American government can manipulate the media,&quot; he says. &quot;We used to have a phenomenal relationship with the media, they&apos;ve kind of turned on us now because they&apos;ve created us into such a monstrous thing...like they made us too big, like they Obama-sized us....&quot;  \nSee The Hills&apos; most controversial moments\nHeidi says her new beliefs will be taken &quot;very seriously&quot; because, &quot;I&apos;ve always been a very serious Christian, and most Christians understand what&apos;s going on.

(Diaz was most recently linked to Jennifer Aniston&apos;s ex, British model Paul Sculfor.)\r\n&quot;What&apos;s changed from 10 years ago is that now I want a man who knows who he is.

I mean, look at a car- it runs on gasoline, so you&apos;re not going to go and fill it up with Jell-O,&quot; she says. &quot;Our bodies are machines too -- we just haven&apos;t been taught that.&quot;  \r\n\r\nDiaz admits it&apos;s &quot;incredibly important&quot; for her to feel sexy.  &quot;It&apos;s part of being an animal, it&apos;s part of being human. You have to feel sexy -- and I mean in the way that you feel sexy. Not in the images you see that say, &apos;This is what sexy is -- you have to look like this to be sexy,&apos; or &apos;You have to fit into this dress or this lingerie.&apos; Sexy can be anything.

(Katherine Jackson remains the children&apos;s temporary guardian until then.)\r\nBut in 2003,  Rowe &#x2013; whose babies were born through artificial insemination (dad is Arnold Klein, Jackson&apos;s L.A.-based dermatologist) &#x2013; sat down with Us&apos; Ian Drew and confessed she &quot;never&quot; wanted to be a mother.\r\n&quot;Parenting is an art; you earn the title,&quot; Rowe, now 50, said during the interview, which is featured in the new issue of Us Weekly (on newsstands now). &quot;Because you give birth and impregnate someone does not automatically give you the title of mother or father &#x2013; you earn the title.\r\n\r\n&quot;My kids don&apos;t call me mom because I don&apos;t want them to,&quot; she went on. &quot;They are Michael&apos;s children. It&apos;s not that they&apos;re not my children, but I had them because I wanted him to be a father.&quot;\r\nAfter Rowe and Jackson divorced in 1999 after three years of marriage, she agreed to give up her parental rights, insisting Jackson was a good father.  \r\n\r\nDuring her 2003 interview with Drew, Rowe addressed critics who claimed she abandoned her kids.\r\n&quot;They say, &apos;I can&apos;t believe she left her children.&apos; Left them? I did not leave my children,&quot; Rowe told Drew. &quot;My children are with their father where they are supposed to be.&quot;  \r\n\r\nAsked why the children are not with her, she said, &quot;I didn&apos;t do it to be a mother. Like I said, you earn the title. I didn&apos;t change diapers. I didn&apos;t get up in the middle of the night - even when I was there. Michael did it all. I am telling you that he is the most brilliant father. Almost before the baby needed something, he knew what it was. And that&apos;s not for me.&quot;\r\n\r\nShe added that she never wanted children before she wed Jackson.\r\n&quot;If it hadn&apos;t been for how much I love him and because of our relationship, I would never have had children,&quot; she told Drew. &quot;And how spoiled am I? I get to go through the whole experience with a loving, caring person, and I can still have the opportunity to have the life I never thought I would have back again. I am still waiting for that and working on it. I&apos;m the one who feels selfish about having the kids.&quot;\r\nSee more photos of Debbie Rowe by photo agency X17", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/debbie-rowe-i-never-wanted-to-be-a-mother-200987/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Debbie Rowe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/debbie-rowe/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Katherine Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/katherine-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/debbie-rowe-i-never-wanted-to-be-a-mother-200987/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/debbie-rowe-i-never-wanted-to-be-a-mother-200987/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Debbie Rowe: I &#8220;Never&#8221;

His audition, which included dancing and singing for the film&apos;s director Kenny Ortega and the film&apos;s producers, was brutal.   &quot;It was, like, five hours of the most rigorous tests ever,&quot; Crawford says. &quot;I walked out very confident.&quot;\r\nCheck out Chace&apos;s yearbook photo!\r\nStill, the actor doesn&apos;t plan to do some of the more elaborate choreography from the original.   &quot;I don&apos;t know if the gymnastics [high bar] scene is going to make it,&quot; says Crawford, who will soon begin an Ortega-plotted training regimen before filming begins next March. &quot;I&apos;ve got some movement in me, but I&apos;m not a dancer.&quot;   He jokes: &quot;I need to start stretching now.&quot;  Although Crawford, 23, wasn&apos;t born when the 1984 film -- starring Kevin Bacon -- hit theaters, he says he&apos;s excited to be one step closer in the famous Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game.\r\nFind out what your favorite Gossip Girl stars looked like as kids.\r\n&quot;I want my number to be up -- my Bacon number,&quot; he says.\r\nAnother young star who will get the same opportunity will be Dancing With the Stars&apos; Julianne Hough.

Hough&apos;s recent success as a country music star could give her an advantage.   &quot;It&apos;s a much more singing-intensive movie for the female lead,&quot; producer Neil Meron says.   The new Footloose, which won&apos;t be a &quot;burst-into-song&quot; type of movie musical, will pay homage to the original with possible cameos by the first cast and the performance of the familiar title song.   &quot;The classic hit songs from the movie will be sung,&quot; producer Craig Zadan says. &quot;There will be new songs that will be written by new artists, and those will be soundtrack songs.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chace Crawford", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/chace-crawford/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kevin Bacon", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kevin-bacon/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Chace Crawford on Footloose: &#8220;I Need to Start Stretching Now&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-05-28T16:38:27+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:00+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 468, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#respond"]}], "description": "\"I've got some movement in me, but I'm not a dancer,\" he says of shooting the remake"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/", "name": "Chace Crawford on Footloose: \"I Need to Start Stretching Now\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-28T16:38:27+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:00+00:00", "description": "\"I've got some movement in me, but I'm not a dancer,\" he says of shooting the remake", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Chace Crawford attends the 2009 The CW Network UpFront on May 21, 2009 in New York City.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chace-crawford-on-footloose-i-need-to-start-stretching-now-2009285/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Chace Crawford on Footloose: &#8220;I Need to Start Stretching Now&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

The memorial would be &quot;fit for the prince of peace and a memorial that&apos;s fit for Gary, Indiana&apos;s favorite son, the greatest entertainer that ever lived.&quot;\nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nGary officials may even propose that that the singer be buried near a proposed Jackson family museum and a performing arts center, Clay&apos;s spokeswoman Lalosa Burns said.\n&quot;The mayor had spoken with a contact of the Jackson family and expressed our interest in having that to be a part of the history of this great family,&quot; Burns said. &quot;We have not received confirmation on that.&quot;  \nSee photos of Michael Jackson and his kids through the years\nOn Tuesday, fans gathered for a public tribute to Jackson at Harlem&apos;s Apollo Theater, where the singer performed as a child.\nJackson died at age 50 June 25 after suffering cardiac arrest.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/private-public-funerals-set-for-michael-jackson-2009306/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/private-public-funerals-set-for-michael-jackson-2009306/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/private-public-funerals-set-for-michael-jackson-2009306/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Private, Public Funerals Set for Michael Jackson", "datePublished": "2009-06-30T18:57:49+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:18+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/private-public-funerals-set-for-michael-jackson-2009306/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 337, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/private-public-funerals-set-for-michael-jackson-2009306/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/private-public-funerals-set-for-michael-jackson-2009306/#respond"]}], "description": "Fans can pay their respects Friday at Neverland Ranch;

I&apos;m not very graceful, so it&apos;s just something that absolutely terrifies me, and it&apos;s the main reason that I kind of wanted to do it. I wanted to do something different. I wanted to do something that scared me, and I don&apos;t think anything could scare me more.&quot;  \nSee who else will compete next season on DWTS\nShe said she&apos;ll find out her partner on Friday, but she doesn&apos;t care who she winds up with.  \nSee amazing DWTS makeovers\n&quot;I&apos;m just excited to be a part of it,&quot; she said. &quot;A couple of years ago, I was in Chicago on [London&apos;s] West End and I was originally meant to be Roxie but when it came down to doing the dancing, I couldn&apos;t learn the dancing in time because I can&apos;t dance, so I went and did Mama Morton instead.&quot;\nThough some of previous contestants have had a dancing background, &quot;there is a good percentage of them who don&apos;t and it&apos;s fun,&quot; said Osbourne. &quot;You make mistakes, you learn and it&apos;ll be like a team of people going on a journey together, so it&apos;ll be fun.&quot;\nSee embarrassing photos of stars dancing\nShe said she doesn&apos;t care if she wins, either.\n&quot;I&apos;m not doing this to try and prove that I&apos;m better than someone else at something,&quot;

Just 40 pounds of fat now gone from my body, but wow, it&apos;s pretty much all I get asked about. In the last year, I got to star in a movie, wrote and directed my next one, and adopted a three year old from American Foster Care. But guess what I&apos;m asked- how did I lose the weight?&quot; the My Life in Ruins actress, 46, writes on CNN&apos;s AC360 Blog.\nCheck out pics of scary skinny stars.\n&quot;I am embarrassed to be in the position of answering questions about my body again. On the publicity tour of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I was asked over and over again, if, as the writer, I felt it was a fair depiction of real life to have someone of my er, below average looks, hook up with hottie John Corbett.  \nSee photos of celebs who went from hunk to chunk.\n&quot;It&apos;s been years, and I have sat through many a movie like Sideways, where nobody blinks an eye when Paul Giamatti gets together with gorgeous Virginia Madsen. And, then Knocked Up...well, the visual of Seth Rogan on top of Katherine Heigl made me put the popcorn down and reach for my purse. Not because I was grossed out, but because I knew the film was about to stop and Ashton Kutcher would now jump out and go &apos;Aha, you&apos;ve been Punk&apos;d, that would never happen.&apos; I waited. But no Ashton. The film went on. And many a reviewer, who probably look like sweet Seth (yes, even the women) gave it a thumbs up.&quot;\nVardalos admits there&apos;s a &quot;double standard for women. Whatever, yawn, we all know it, perpetuate it.&quot;\nSee before and after photos of Us&apos; weight winners.\n&quot;So, it&apos;s our fault. Let&apos;s accept it and move on. Socially, the issue of men&apos;s weight is simply not a big deal. Let&apos;s face it: Russell Crowe is fat and no one ever talks about it. Alec Baldwin just orders his suits a size bigger and we continue to swoon.&quot;\nVardalos says &quot;the truth&quot; about her weight loss is that she &quot;had a blood sugar problem&quot; and her doctor ordered her to drop weight.  &quot;It was really hard, but I did it through exercise, and it took a year,&quot; she admits.\nFind out how more stars get fit.\nIf not for her health issues, the actress would have kept her curves, she says.  &quot;I thought I was attractive when I shot My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them,&quot; she says. &quot;In other words, they labeled me with words like: overweight, unattractive, unappealing.&quot;\n&quot;Hey, just say fat.

I still love my potato chips. I try to eat organic, but it&apos;s ... really expensive and not everybody can do that,&quot; Walsh continues.\r\nTo combat her sweet tooth, Walsh says, she&apos;s tried every diet on the market.\r\n\r\n&quot;I&apos;ve done every diet there is. When I quit smoking years ago, I did the cabbage soup diet. I went on Atkins because I was going to have foot surgery,&quot; Walsh -- whose Private Practice premieres Oct. 1 on ABC -- has told Women&apos;s Health magazine. &quot;I knew I wouldn&apos;t be able to move or work out, and I was afraid of becoming huge.

And it&apos;s not ideal,&quot; Bingo Gubelmann told Usmagazine.com at the Thursday premiere. &quot;It&apos;s frustrating, but I&apos;m not going to sit here and trash her because we&apos;re young as a company and we&apos;ve got to live and learn...I don&apos;t want to be known as the producer that will turn on any actress at the drop of that hat.&quot;\r\nSee the day&apos;s top news photos.\r\nWhile rolling his eyes, Gubelmann continued that &quot;it&apos;s hard to remember&quot; why he chose Barton to star in his indie flick, &quot;because, you know, she&apos;s not here right now.  &quot;Now, I haven&apos;t spoken to her yet because she&apos;s totally unreachable, so I don&apos;t know exactly what happened. I mean, I&apos;m not as good at taking the high road a some people and yes, it would obviously be nice if she was here. Even just to hang out,&quot; he went on.\r\n\r\nGubelmann said Barton didn&apos;t seem &quot;at all&quot; unstable while shooting the flick in less than a month, 16 hours a day.  &quot;She did it and she did an amazing job. It&apos;s like, maybe she went method and maybe that&apos;s what happened!&quot; he said, laughing.  Producer Austin Stark was more sympathetic toward the actress, who required a police escort from her Hollywood Hills home to the hospital.\r\n\r\n&quot;I think we would have loved to have had her come out and support the movie, [but] you know, we wish her the best and obviously we hope she gets better,&quot; he told Us. &quot;Obviously, it&apos;s a trying time for her. I mean, obviously we&apos;d like her to be here but I don&apos;t think it hurts the movie.&quot;  Added producer Benji Kohn: &quot;She&apos;s going through a rough patch and she can&apos;t be here. And it&apos;s really too bad.&quot;  Director Morgan J. Freeman told Us: &quot;I hope Mischa is doing OK. My thoughts and prayers are with her.

To me, invitations were just paper that contain important information, and upon first look, it usually gets thrown away. Well, my entire perception of invitations was thrown out the window when I walked into the&#xA0;Ceci New York studio. The walls didn&apos;t need any artwork, because they were filled with some of the most amazing invitations I had ever set eyes upon, including invitations for events hosted by&#xA0;Diddy, and&#xA0;Katherine Heigl&apos;s wedding. There were invitations that were on plexi-glass and wine bottles, and envelopes made of velvet and encrusted with jewels. Words could not do these invitations justice.\r\nWe had the pleasure of meeting Lisa Hoffman, who was so sweet and helpful. She wanted to create a very personal and meaningful invitation for us. When she told us she can do anything we wanted, she really meant it! There isn&apos;t anything that this woman cannot do. She ended up designing us a simple yet classy invitation that incorporated our color scheme consisting of warm fall colors, and even added personal touches, such as the laser cut pattern that is on my wedding dress! I cannot wait to start getting the beautiful metallic RSVP envelopes in my mailbox! These dream invitations really set the tone for our dream wedding!\r\nThe pattern on&#xA0;my Vera Wang wedding gown&#xA0;will be duplicated on the cinnamon brown invites (which cost $4,600). They&apos;ll also be addressed in hand hand calligraphy.\r\nFind out more about wedding invitations on WeddingChannel.com.\r\n&#xA0;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/my-invitations-really-set-the-tone-for-my-dream-wedding-2009149/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 313}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/my-invitations-really-set-the-tone-for-my-dream-wedding-2009149/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/my-invitations-really-set-the-tone-for-my-dream-wedding-2009149/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "My Invitations &#8220;Really Set the Tone&#8221;

Season five has finally picked up its momentum, and this week&apos;s episode of Project Runway did not disappoint. To start off, the designers were told they were going on a field trip. After speculation of whom or what they would be designing for (Mariah Carey? A celebrity rooftop party?), they found themselves not at Mood Fabrics, but atop a parking garage. The challenge was to design an outfit using...car parts!\r\nTo start off the challenge, the designers had four minutes to rush over to a set of Saturn hybrids that were filled with car parts and accessories and grab as much material as they could. With no time to prepare beforehand, the designers had to grab what they could and hope for the best later.   After returning to Parsons, out came the hammers and gloves, but this time, the hammering and breaking was not done solely by Stella. Cuts and scrapes from the car parts ensued, causing Suede to go into his routine third-person diatribe. Keith became increasingly irritable and ended up snapping at his model for *gasp* sitting down to get her hair done at the TRESemme salon, which caused a rip in the skirt. Kenley&apos;s stress level went from high to maniacal when she learned that her model had to suddenly drop out of the competition, which topped off when she was already severely behind and had to re-work her design to fit the new model. Terri began to make fun of Korto&apos;s &quot;scarecrow&quot; but it turned out the joke was on her when Korto&apos;s design ended up amongst the top, and Terri got just a qualifying score to move on to the next challenge.    A surprise replacement for Nina Garcia&apos;s judging spot was Season 3 finalist Laura Bennett, and the celebrity guest judge for the week was stylist to the stars Rachel Zoe - who, ironically, has a show premiering shortly on Bravo. With that line-up, the panel was no doubt relentless on the designers when it came to runway time.   Blayne made a valiant effort to produce a garment with a different aesthetic. Unfortunately, the silhouette was misshaped and the final product fell flat. With fabrics like rubber and leather, one would think this would be &quot;Stella the Leatha&apos;s&quot; time to shine. Instead she took a chance at making something &quot;pretty&quot; with a skirt made of seatbelts and a top with a combination of fabrics that ended up missing the mark completely.  Jerrell really flexed his innovative muscles with a futuristic corset-like top and leather mini, but the big wow factor of the night was Leanne with her awesome cocktail dress with a twist of avant-garde that you wouldn&apos;t even know was made from car floorboards.     Kenley, Joe, Suede and Terri were safe for this round, and after a close run for number one between Korto, Leanne and Jerrell, Leanne prevailed as the top designer for the challenge.  Blayne made it safe but it seems his days are numbered. Stella didn&apos;t take a top spot as anticipated at the beginning of the challenge, but ended up in the bottom two and held on by a thread.  And Keith, after questioning himself and his design technique, ultimately failed and he was sent home.\r\nSeason five is moving along steadily, and we are finally getting a closer glimpse of who has the potential to make it to the final challenge.

In a suit obtained by TMZ.com, Richelle Olson, executive director of California&apos;s Desert Valley Charities, claims she was told Bruno was a celebrity who would appear and call numbers at the charity bingo game she ran for the elderly.  Bruno, she says in her legal papers, was an &quot;extreme, outrageous, offensive caricature of a gay man dressed in sexually revealing clothing with an Austrian accent...&quot;\nSee photos of more celebs acting silly\nShe claims he used &quot;vulgar and offensive language&quot; and a &quot;physical struggle ensued&quot; when she tried taking the microphone from him. According to her suit, Cohen also &quot;offensively touched, pushed and battered&quot; her, causing her to fall to the ground.  Three cameramen then rushed the stage ... &quot;where defendants attacked [her] for a period of one to five minutes to intentionally create a dramatic emotional response ... while [they] recorded her humiliation and embarrassment,&quot; the suit claims.\nSee photos of embarrassing celeb moments\nWhen the alleged assault ended, Olson went into another room where she was &quot;sobbing uncontrollably&quot; ... then was rendered unconscious ... &quot;falling forward onto the thinly covered concrete slab, passing out and causing her to hit her head,&quot; according to the suit.\nCan you spot Sacha Baron Cohen&apos;s wife in Us&apos; Baby Bump Hall of Fame gallery?\nOlson says she also was rushed to the hospital with a &quot;diagnosis of two brain bleeds&quot; -- and has since been confined to a wheelchair and walker.  Cohen and NBC Universal are among the parties she is suing for $25,000 in damages.  A rep for Cohen and NBC Universal has yet to comment.  Earlier this week, Bruno made headlines by landing face-down in Eminem&apos;s lap, causing the rapper to curse and storm out of Sunday&apos;s MTV Movie Awards.\nSee red carpet photos from the 2009 MTV Movie Awards\nTurns out, the incident was staged, a show writer said Tuesday.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Eminem", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/eminem/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sacha Baron Cohen", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/sacha-baron-cohen/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "More Bruno Drama: Sacha Baron Cohen Is Sued", "datePublished": "2009-06-03T17:49:52+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:17+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 390, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#respond"]}], "description": "Dressed as his new flamboyant character, he is accused of leaving a woman \"crippled\" at a bingo hall"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/", "name": "More Bruno Drama: Sacha Baron Cohen Is Sued", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-03T17:49:52+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:17+00:00", "description": "Dressed as his new flamboyant character, he is accused of leaving a woman \"crippled\" at a bingo hall", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Sacha Baron Cohen as \"Bruno\" arrives at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards Arrivals at the Gibson Amphitheatre on May 31, 2009 in Universal City, CA.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/more-bruno-drama-sacha-baron-cohen-is-sued-200936/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "More Bruno Drama: Sacha Baron Cohen Is Sued"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

This was very public.

The star, 24, admitted that she was one of those women.   &quot;I definitely did [take diet pills],&quot; Osbourne told Us. &quot;Of course. I live in L.A. -- every female does. I started hanging with people in Hollywood. You can never say that someone forced you or got you into it, but as a result of hanging out, the door was opened on what ways there are to lose weight and not really have to work out.&quot;  She even told Us that she used Adderall, the same prescription drug -- usually given to people for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- that Us Weekly reported super-skinny Lindsay Lohan uses to stay thin.\r\nCheck out Lindsay Lohan&apos;s weight ups and downs through the years.\r\n&quot;Adderall ... I did abuse because it was fun,&quot; she said. &quot;If you take them as they are prescribed, I don&apos;t think there is a problem with them. They help people get healthy... You just have to do it the right way.&quot;  Osbourne, who said she is now simply trying to remain &quot;healthy,&quot; recommends that anyone considering diet pills only take them through a therapist.\r\nSee photos of Kelly Osbourne&apos;s winning style.\r\n&quot;I think that is the only way you can do it,&quot; she said. &quot;You have to have someone checking in and make sure you are held accountable and doing things the right way. There is no such thing as a quick fix for anything in life.

Though she tells Mesnick. &quot;I could see myself having a relationship with you,&quot; he turns her down explaining that he&apos;s fallen hard for both Rycroft and Malaney.    At the final rose ceremony, Mesnick rejects a shocked Malaney who responds by telling him, &quot;I think you&apos;ve made a mistake, a big one.&quot;\r\nThe single dad then gets down on bended knee to propose to Rycroft, asking her to &quot;make me the happiest man&quot; by agreeing to marry him. The show cuts out with the happy couple jumping into the pool.\r\nCheck out which former Bachelor contestants are still with their final pick.\r\nHowever six weeks later, at the After the Final Rose special, a tearful Mesnick tells Bachelor host Chris Harrison that the &quot;chemistry is completely different&quot; with him and Rycroft and that he hasn&apos;t been able to stop thinking of Malaney. He then tells his blindsided (and angry) Rycroft, &quot;We&apos;re not right for each other.&quot; After breaking things off with his fiancee, Mesnick then asks Malaney for another shot, admitting that he&apos;s still in love with her.

Rihanna did not have to testify.\nBrown arrived at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center at 1:30 PDT this afternoon for the hearing. He was escorted inside by eight uniformed officers and a bodyguard.   \nSee photos of stars in court\nBrown -- who donned a gray striped suit, brown shoes and striped tie --  appeared solemn, according to a witness. His mother followed behind him. The duo were both looking down.\nRihanna wore a black dress, sunglasses and pearls to the hearing, but was not in the courtroom when the judge handed down his decision to Brown.\nAfter Brown left the courtroom, Rihanna entered through a private entrance. She and her lawyer, Donald Etra, discussed the protective order with Judge Patricia Schnegg.\nBecause the two might appear at the same public events, the judge said that in those instances, the 50-yard stay away order would turn into a 10-yard order.\nIn addition, the judge said that the two-way order prevents Rihanna from contacting Brown at any point. Etra told the judge several times that such a stay-away order was not necessary, but Schnegg said she wanted to be cautious.\nLook back at Chris and Rihanna&apos;s happier days\nBrown turned himself into police in February for allegedly beating Rihanna. He was charged with two felonies.  He&apos;ll be formally sentenced Aug. 5.\nAfter the hearing, Geragos addressed the media outside the courthouse.    &quot;This is a kid who has never been in trouble before, who wants to move past this,&quot; his attorney said. &quot;He has accepted responsibility and will continue to do so. He embraces this as an opportunity to get his life back on track and his career back on track.&quot;\nGeragos said that although Brown wanted to thank his fans, he has restricted the singer from making a statement until after his official sentencing.\nRihanna&apos;s lawyer, Etra, also spoke to reporters and said that his client was &quot;feeling fine&quot; after the hearing.\n&quot;She was fully prepared to testify, and she would have told he truth about what happened that evening,&quot; he said.\nHe added that he and Rihanna -- who felt the protective order was sufficient but that the stay-away order was unnecessary -- would discuss a reduction in the latter.\nSchnegg said she would consider such a change only after the August sentencing.", "isPartOf": {"@id":

Knight, leaving the hit medical drama Grey&apos;s Anatomy was the &quot;best decision&quot; he could have ever made.\r\nThe actor tells the latest issue Entertainment Weekly that he left the hit ABC show after executive producer Shonda Rhimes drastically cut his screen time this past season -- he appeared for only 48 minutes in the first nine episodes -- and showed concern over his decision to become openly gay.\r\nSee photos of hot TV doctors\r\n&quot;There just comes a time when it&apos;s so clear that moving on is the best decision,&quot; Knight tells EW (on newsstands Friday).\r\nKnight, who had played series regular Dr. George O&apos;Malley for all five seasons, also says there was a &quot;breakdown in communication&quot; with Rhimes.\r\nAlthough Rhimes has said she purposefully cut Knight&apos;s character from recent episodes so his disappearance in the May finale -- in which he appeared to have died after he was struck by a bus -- wouldn&apos;t have been noticeable to audiences, the star says it wasn&apos;t justified.\r\nSee photos of the cozy couples of Grey&apos;s Anatomy\r\n&quot;It didn&apos;t seem like an ebb to me,&quot; he says. &quot;No other series regular&apos;s character had ever disappeared like mine did this past season.&quot;\r\nHe also felt he didn&apos;t understand his character, especially when he slept with his best friend Izzie (played by Katherine Heigl) while he was married.   &quot;My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [about George],&quot; he says.\r\nSee more TV stars who are undergoing big changes!\r\nKnight also cites the dismissal of former costar Isaiah Washington, who used an anti-gay slur on set. It took Rhimes three months to publicly condemn Washington, which Knight calls &quot;frustrating.&quot;\r\nThe incident brought about another problem for Knight. He says complications arose between him and Rhimes when he decided to respond to the situation by coming out publicly.\r\n&quot;I think she was concerned about having my statement come out so close to the [initial] event,&quot; he says, adding that she was among those who encouraged him to stay in the closet.\r\nAlthough he got out of his $14 million contract three years early, he has no regrets.   &quot;There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position,&quot; he says. &quot;But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work -- that&apos;s more important than the money.&quot;\r\nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories\r\nKnight, who was asked to appear on the show&apos;s sixth season in flashbacks but refused, is currently working on theater projects.\r\nIn September, he&apos;ll headline a stage production of Parade in L.A. and will debut on Broadway in the Stanley Tucci-directed revival of Lend Me a Tenor in February.\r\nDespite speculation that Heigl would leave the show with her off-screen pal, she recently began filming the show&apos;s next season.\r\n&quot;It&apos;s a little bizarre,&quot; she told Usmagazine.com about working without Knight. &quot;I had to call him this morning and say, &apos;OK, so this is what happened yesterday! This is what scenes we shot, this is how I felt about it.&apos; He&apos;s who I went to everyday when I wanted to vent or to get advice.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/tr-knight-leaving-greys-anatomy-was-the-best-decision-2009237/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Isaiah Washington", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/isaiah-washington/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Katherine Heigl", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/katherine-heigl/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Shonda Rhimes", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/shonda-rhimes/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "T.R.

He always ate too little and mixed too much.&quot;   \nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nDistraught over Jackson&apos;s drug use, she once proposed an intervention, contacting his mother Katherine and sister Janet for help, only to find herself fired by the King of Pop.  &quot;He didn&apos;t want to listen; that was one of the times he let me go,&quot; says Rwaramba, who started out as an office assistant.\nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nRwaramba, who was last fired in December, also sheds light on Jackson&apos;s debt (he was reportedly awash in about $400 million in debt at the time of his death).  Last April, when she visited Jackson&apos;s children -- Prince, now 12; Paris, 11; and Blanket, 7 -- she had to buy balloons for Paris&apos; birthday because the singer was so broke.\nSays Rwaramba, &quot;Michael had no idea about money.&quot;  \nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\nOn Friday, the day after Jackson died, Rwaramba  says the singer&apos;s mother Katherine called her from Michael&apos;s rented L.A. house and asked where he kept his money. &quot;She said, &apos;Grace, the children are crying. They are asking about you. They can&apos;t believe that their father died. Grace, you remember Michael used to hide cash at the house. I am here.

Foster also has three sons from a previous relationship.\r\n&quot;People say that she just had a baby so that she could get paid,&quot; Dewitt tells Us. &quot;Why can&apos;t you just be a regular person who has a wonderful job, a great career, who&apos;s well respected for the work that they do, and be happy with that and then just fall in love with someone? Then you turn into a gold-digger? How does that happen?&quot;\r\nDewitt also dispels reports that Usher is actually gay.   &quot;No way -- I believe unequivocally that he is a straight man,&quot; she tells Us. &quot;That&apos;s never been an issue.&quot;  \r\n\r\nShe also says the fact that Usher was eight years her junior was overplayed in the media.  &quot;A lot of people marry guys that are younger, or a lot of men marry women that are much younger, but it doesn&apos;t seem to have the same range of hostility toward it,&quot; she says.\r\nIn fact, when the couple was first married in August 2007, Dewitt says they were truly in love.  &quot;They just seemed to really complement one another in that way and bring out one another&apos;s strengths and balance each other out.&quot;\r\nAnd what about reports that Usher&apos;s mother, Jonetta Patton, disapproved of Foster and was against their wedding?  \r\n\r\n&quot;I have never personally witnessed any hard feelings,&quot; she says. &quot;I can&apos;t say for sure whether his mom is involved in any way. I know that she is a grandmother, and that&apos;s good. That&apos;s good to have in your life, in your children&apos;s lives.&quot;\r\nWhen Usher filed for divorce on June 12, Dewitt says Foster was &quot;blind-sided.&quot;\r\n&quot;They had experienced some challenges from March, but she was definitely thinking that they were working through it,&quot; she tells Us. &quot;I don&apos;t believe that she felt that a divorce was eminent. She was not informed that divorce papers had been filed. She found out probably just like everyone else did.&quot;\r\nNow, she says Foster is focusing on her work and her children.   Dewitt, who says she loves Usher, believes the two will remain friends.   &quot;I really think that they can be friends,&quot; she says.\r\n&quot;The essence of their relationship is friendship, and hopefully they can maintain that. That&apos;s what it&apos;s all about. They are parents. Both of them are wonderful parents, and they both love their children... I hope and pray that they can really recover their friendship after all is said and done.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/friend-tameka-foster-raymond-was-not-a-gold-digger-with-usher-2009237/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Tameka Foster Raymond", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/tameka-foster-raymond/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Usher", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/usher/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/friend-tameka-foster-raymond-was-not-a-gold-digger-with-usher-2009237/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/friend-tameka-foster-raymond-was-not-a-gold-digger-with-usher-2009237/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Friend: Tameka Foster Raymond Was Not a &#8220;Gold-Digger&#8221;

I am sorry and hope I have not let any young supporters down but wish them the best of luck in fulfilling their dreams.&quot;\r\nMiss California USA pageant director Keith Lewis told Us in a statement: &quot;Shanna has, and will continue to be, a large part of my life. Although I am sad she has come to this decision, I will always respect the convictions that brought her to this place.&quot;  Prejean, 21, first ignited controversy at the April 19 pageant when she told judge Perez Hilton that she believed marriage should be between only a man and a woman, igniting a cultural debate. The runner-up said her answer cost her the crown.  \r\n\r\nPrejean later announced that she&apos;ll be launching a campaign opposing gay marriage with the National Organization for Marriage.  Shortly after, Moakler announced she was appearing in new ad supporting gay rights. She shot a print ad April 28 slamming  Proposition 8, the initiative that bans gay marriage in California.  On Tuesday, pageant owner Donald Trump announced Prejean would keep her crown despite failing to reveal she had posed in her underwear as a teenager.  (Prejean said the pictures were leaked to humiliate her because of her anti-gay marriage views, calling it a &quot;vicious and mean-spirited&quot; attacks. Even more photos hit the web before Trump&apos;s press conference Tuesday morning.)  \r\n\r\nOn Monday, California pageant officials announced that Prejean violated her contract by lobbying on behalf of an anti-gay-marriage group and by failing to reveal that she had posed in her underwear as a teenager.  They appointed Tami Farrell, her runner-up, as &quot;Beauty of California Ambassador&quot; to fulfill any duties that Prejean might not be able to carry out.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Donald Trump", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/donald-trump/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Shanna Moakler", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/shanna-moakler/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Shanna Moakler Resigns as Miss California Pageant Director", "datePublished": "2009-05-13T22:01:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:24+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 525, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#respond"]}], "description": "\"I cannot [keep] supporting and promoting the Miss Universe organization when I no longer believe in it,\" she tells Us"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/", "name": "Shanna Moakler Resigns as Miss California Pageant Director", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-13T22:01:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:24+00:00", "description": "\"I cannot supporting and promoting the Miss Universe organization when I no longer believe in it,\" she tells Us", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Miss California USA, Carrie Prejean and Miss California USA Executive Director Shanna Moakler attends a press conference at Trump Tower on May 12, 2009 in New York City.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shanna-moakler-resigns-as-miss-california-pageant-director-2009135/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Shanna Moakler Resigns as Miss California Pageant Director"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Since we&apos;re whipping up a wedding to suit the stars, Us Weekly asked me to share my some tips for planning a platinum affair on a, well, &quot;2009&quot; budget:\r\nParty on a Tuesday! (Or any day but Saturday)\r\n&#xA0;Hey, aren&apos;t the Oscars on a Sunday night? The stars are decked out seven days a week. Make like a celeb and host your affair on ANY DAY but Saturday night. Even better, plan quickly like Van and Eric who picked a Sunday two months out, and you might grab a date that&apos;s still open. Save big bucks on the venue&#x2014;and other vendors, too.\r\nFind more affordable wedding ideas\r\n&quot;Luxe/Less&quot; Your Look\r\nNow, we&apos;re not saying you should wear a Gap tank with an Armani silk ballgown skirt &#x2026; but why not? When it comes to looking like the glam goddesses of Hollywood, pick your priorities. There&apos;s no rule that says you have to pair your $5,000 gown with Jimmy Choo shoes. Splurge on the gown, and hit the mall like my client Lisa Loeb did (who found Charles Jourdan jeweled shoes off-the-rack). Stop by Payless, which now carries designer shoes by celebrity style maven Lela Rose &#xA0;(who&apos;s doing Van&apos;s bridesmaid dresses and shoes). They&apos;re just $44.99! (You can browse wedding day fashion by budget at Weddingchannel.com/gowns).\r\nTap Your Inner Foodie\r\nWhat, Wolfgang Puck &quot;not available&quot; to cater your big day? Not to fret. Chefs from Tampa to Tacoma are all turning up the heat on fun, personalized wedding day food. Go casual-chic like Sandra Bullock and Jesse James, who served up Southern BBQ picnic style, or Julia Roberts and husband Danny Moder, who celebrated their Fourth of July wedding with hot dogs, lemon chicken and corn on the cob. For dessert, Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O&apos;Connell offered mini-country apple and red velvet cupcakes. We&apos;re so excited that Chef Xavier Deshayes of The Ronald Reagan Building &#xA0;is going to deliver Van &amp; Eric&apos;s signature &quot;Trackerita&quot; paired with mini Pork Tenderloin Sandwiches at cocktail hour as an ode to their annual Indy 500 trip. &#xA0;\r\n\r\n&#xA0;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 401}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Celeb Wedding Planner: How to Throw a Perfect Event", "datePublished": "2009-09-17T22:48:02+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-10-15T21:07:56+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 464, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": ["Celebrity Style"], "articleSection": ["Star Style"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#respond"]}], "description": "Amy Shey Jacobs offers the best ideas for planning a luxe party for less"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/", "name": "Celeb Wedding Planner: How to Throw a Perfect Event", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-09-17T22:48:02+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-10-15T21:07:56+00:00", "description": "Amy Shey Jacobs offers the best ideas for planning a luxe party for less", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 401, "caption": "1253223223_van ngo 2902"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/red-carpet-affair-on-a-stimulus-budget-2009179/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Celeb Wedding Planner: How to Throw a Perfect Event"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Her third book, Love Is in the Mix: Making Meals into Memories, is due to hit stores Oct. 13, 2009, according to Amazon.com.\nSee Jon and Kate Gosselin through the years.\nThe Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 star is already the author of Multiple Bles8ings: Surviving to Thriving with Twins and Sextuplets and the recently released Eight Little Faces, for which she has recently traveled the nation to promote.  &quot;Fans ... won&apos;t want to miss this inside look at one of America&apos;s most famous close-knit families,&quot; the back cover states.\nSee photos of reality love gone bad.\nIn addition to offering nutritious recipes and tips on eating organically, Love Is in the Mix promises to teach readers &quot;how to craft family traditions that create happy memories&quot; and &quot;how to feed a large family on a budget.&quot; The book will include family photos and anecdotes about her twins and sextuplets.  According to the site, Kate will also offer insight into handling picky eaters, making lunchtime fun, planning meals for vacations, and making ordinary days &quot;extra special.&quot;\nSee what your favorite stars look like with Kate Gosselin&apos;s hairdo.\n Although excerpts from the book have not yet been released, commenters have already begun slamming the star&apos;s previously released recipes and claim she stole them &quot;from product boxes and magazine articles.&quot;  One person wrote that her recipe for the cereal treat Monkey Munch -- which was mentioned on the TLC show -- is the same as one on the Chex brand website and calls it &quot;plagiarism.&quot;\nSee photos of Jon Gosselin and his mistress.\nOther commenters were shocked that the woman who once said that &quot;real cooks don&apos;t need recipes&quot; was qualified to write a cookbook. They wrote on Amazon.com that on the show, Kate does little to &quot;no cooking, no meals, just snacks -- crackers, yogurt, grapes, cukes and peppers in pita. The woman can&apos;t cook.&quot;  Still, with Kate&apos;s previous two books reaching the New York Times Best Seller list, the book&apos;s publishers are likely expecting similar success with Love Is in the Mix. In addition to her income from book sales, the newest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands today, reports that the Gosselins -- who live in a $1.1 million house -- earn approximately $50,000 to $75,000 per show.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Kate Gosselin to Release Love Is in the Mix Cookbook", "datePublished": "2009-05-27T22:04:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:58+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 435, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#respond"]}], "description": "Before its October release, commenters slam the reality star's recipes as \"plagiarism\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/", "name": "Kate Gosselin to Release Love Is in the Mix Cookbook", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-27T22:04:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:58+00:00", "description": "Before its October release, commenters slam the reality star's recipes as \"plagiarism\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Kate Gosselin attends a signing for her books \"Eight Little Faces\" and \"Multiple Bles8ings\" at Barnes & Noble at the Americana April 14, 2009 in Glendale, CA.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-gosselin-to-release-ilove-is-in-the-mixi-cookbook-2009275/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Kate Gosselin to Release Love Is in the Mix Cookbook"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Says Steffen, &quot;Ed&apos;s not worth my time, but if I can help someone avoid heartbreak, I&apos;m gonna do that.&quot;\nSee photos of Jillian Harris through the years.\nAccording to Us Weekly, Swiderski had been dating both Steffen and Johnson behind each other&apos;s backs prior to filming The Bachelorette in late March (the finale, taped in May, aired July 27).\nEven while he was on the hit ABC show he texted Johnson that Harris wasn&apos;t his &quot;type&quot; and that he prefers &quot;all blondes,&quot; she says. &quot;I love you,&quot; he also wrote her.  \nSee which Bachelor stars are still together. \nUs Weekly reports that he lied to Harris when he said he had to bow out of episode five because he thought he&apos;d lose his job as a Chicago Microsoft consultant.    \nRevisit Jillian and Ed&apos;s most romantic Bachelorette moments.\nWhile away, both women say they slept with Swiderski.  He then told them he was off to &quot;a business trip in Texas,&quot; when in reality he returned to film episode seven of The Bachelorette and declare to Harris that he had &quot;reprioritized&quot; when it came to work and romance.\nOf the women&apos;s claims, Harris tells Extra, &quot;It&apos;s not possible... This is a bump in the road and we&apos;ll get through it.&quot;  \nSee more reality couples who didn&apos;t work out.\nBut Steffen warns Harris, &quot;Lindsey and I are both smart girls, and Ed just has this way of making people believe what he wants. Jillian needs to be careful.&quot;  Adds Johnson, &quot;I feel gross, used and completely violated. It shocks me that he was able to do something like that to me.&quot;  \nFor more on Swiderski&apos;s cheating ways - including his steamy e-mails to Steffen and Johnson, how he promised to propose to Johnson by year&apos;s end and how he badmouthed Harris while filming The Bachelorette - pick up the new Us Weekly today!", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Ed Swiderski", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/ed-swiderski/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jillian Harris", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jillian-harris/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Bachelorette Winner Cheated With Two Different Women", "datePublished": "2009-08-05T13:41:04+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:28+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 441, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#respond"]}], "description": "A week after proposing to Jillian Harris, Ed Swiderski slept with one woman and tried to bed another, the new Us Weekly reports"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/", "name": "Bachelorette Winner Cheated With Two Different Women", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-08-05T13:41:04+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:28+00:00", "description": "A week after proposing to Jillian Harris, Ed Swiderski slept with one woman and tried to bed another, the new Us Weekly reports", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Bachelorette b_2", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/ibachelorettei-winner-cheated-with-two-different-women-200958/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Bachelorette Winner Cheated With Two Different Women"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Department stores give birth to complete insanity.  My insider guy at Bergdorf&apos;s, Eddie, informed me that BG will mark down Spring and Summer merchandise to 50% this Thursday. I can hardly contain myself. And I&apos;m not the only one! Women go bananas when there&apos;s a sale, especially on items with big ticket names: YSL, Alaia, Chanel, Manolo, DVF, Stella McCartney, Kors. I have learned that entering a sale this low may cause mental and physical harm to you.\r\nCheck out my tips for successful shopping:\r\n1. Do not drink coffee before a sale. For two reasons: 1) you will be hyped up on caffeine and not think clearly. 2) you will need to go to restroom which is not on the same floor - which means you may/ miss out on that one Valentino floral applique bag.\r\n2. Wear an anorak or some lightweight coat with deep pockets: not because you&apos;re shoplifting, but because you will ditch that suitcase of an &quot;it&quot; bag and keep all your necessities in those deep pockets.\r\n3. Bring a phone to post your finds on Facebook or email a photo to friends to get quick opinions on whether you need yet another Louboutin slingback with a cork platform or a Tory tunic in a color you&apos;ve never seen before.\r\n4. Wear a little black dress, slip or tank - something that will work with all of these sale items: shoes, bags, jackets, etc.\r\n5. Maintain your sanity. There will be bitchy salespeople as well as the bitchiest customers you&apos;ve ever seen. You may also need a translator for all the different New York dialects spoken/spewed at you.\r\nCheck out which celebrities are bargain shoppers too!\r\n6.  Read, ask about, and do not assume the return policy. You may want to know how to get out of something when your husband demands why this is the 60th BG bag in the house this week. BAG TIP: you can always schlep over to Jam paper products [(212) 473-6666] and get those brown paper bags with no name printed on them and switch bags around before you get into the house.\r\n7. There is always, always, always a way to get what you want if you want it that badly. Make friends not enemies with a salesperson and ask them to grab a particular shoe in your size on your behalf, give them your credit card number and instruct them to charge away. Sometimes the hot products end up on hold with no takers and you can breathe once again when that item is in your hot hands. Also, my requests sometimes seem futile, yet suddenly the YSL patent leather, shortie sold out bootie miraculously appears...in my size!\r\n8. If anyone asks: &quot;which color do you wear more often?&quot; &quot;Red goes with everything&quot; &quot;what would you wear more of..?&quot; Slap them! It&quot;s not about that! Or anything that sounds like that? Another slap!\r\n9. Keep your purchases close. I once dropped a left shoe to try on another on-sale left shoe and almost got a back spasm chasing after a rather over zealous customer who took my Miu Miu ballerina thinking it was up for grabs.\r\n10. Have fun! Happy shopping...and listen up, doll: If you think your ass looks fat in that - it probably is, you answered your own question.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Recessionista: Markdown Madness", "datePublished": "2009-06-24T13:48:04+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:00+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 572, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": ["Celebrity Style", "Recessionista"], "articleSection": ["Star Style"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#respond"]}], "description": "Bergdorf Goodman is slashing prices on chic seasonal wardrobe staples 50-60% starting this week"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/", "name": "Recessionista: Markdown Madness", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-24T13:48:04+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:00+00:00", "description": "Bergdorf Goodman is slashing prices on chic seasonal wardrobe staples 50-60% starting this week", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Sale", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-markdown-madness-2009246/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Recessionista: Markdown Madness"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

He was such a quick learner,&quot; he said. &quot;He would learn this stuff in seconds. And jump right into it! The choreography, all of it... He looked fantastic.&quot;\nWhen it was time to sing, Alonzo said Jackson mentioned a seemingly minor ailment.\n&quot;He claimed that he felt he had a little bit of laryngitis. He said &apos;I&apos;m not going to sing this full-out because I have this laryngitis.&apos; But he looked great and these pop-locking moves that he was doing on stage with the crew were just breathtaking... He didn&apos;t seem tired. He went from one move to the next. It was an unbelievable experience to be with him and to see it all come together.&quot;\nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\nMentally, Jackson seemed completely fine.\n&quot;He was joking with the crew on stage,&quot; he said. &quot;There was a cameraman on stage ... that was a foot away from him that was kind of crouched down and Michael said some kind of funny gesture like, &apos;Oh you&apos;re very close, look how close you are.&apos; And he reached down and touched the cameraman on the top of the head in a joking manner. You could see on the screen how big Michael&apos;s image was on these projection screens. He was playful and light-hearted.&quot;\nAlonzo spent the rest of the evening watching him perform.\n&quot;I just thought, &apos;Wow, he still has it,&apos;&quot; he told Us. &quot;When he did &apos;Thriller,&apos; I was just in awe. I stayed for a while, probably until about midnight. And then they started to rehearse the &apos;Thriller&apos; number with a gigantic spider on stage and I thought, &apos;Well, it&apos;s getting late...&apos; Had I known, I would have stayed another half hour and watched more.&quot;\nHe said that Jackson, who appeared to weigh only 120 pounds despite his over-6-foot-tall frame, rehearsed with the dancers until 1 a.m.\nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories\nAt rehearsals the following day, none of the crew knew anything was wrong until media reports began circulating the following afternoon.\n&quot;I wasn&apos;t sure what was happening,&quot; he said. &quot;People were just looking at their phones and looking at websites and texts that they were getting. I think the news was now coming out. [Show producer Kenny] Ortega was on and off the phone probably five or six different times. And the news was slowly coming in, but it was not definitive. And Kenny finally looked at us and said, &apos;We need to call a group meeting.&apos;&quot;\nAlonzo added: &quot;He said, &apos;Michael Jackson was taken to the hospital. We&apos;re not sure at this point what has happened, but Michael Jackson has passed away.&apos; And then there was just this gasp. It was the words we didn&apos;t want to hear.&quot;\nWith the collected group of dancers and crew members in shock, Alonzo said Ortega got choked up as he told them all that they would &quot;wrap for now.&quot;\n&quot;He said, &apos;Michael said he worked with the greatest artists on this event,&apos;&quot; Alonzo told Us. &quot;It was really sad.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Kenny Ortega", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kenny-ortega/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Concert Magician Recalls Michael Jackson&#8217;s Final Hours", "datePublished": "2009-06-26T22:10:08+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:12+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 746, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#respond"]}], "description": "Ed Alonzo tells Us the singer \"was stunning to watch\" but complained of laryngitis at rehearsals Wednesday"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/", "name": "Concert Magician Recalls Michael Jackson's Final Hours", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-26T22:10:08+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:12+00:00", "description": "Ed Alonzo tells Us the singer \"was stunning to watch\" but complained of laryngitis at rehearsals Wednesday", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Alonzo jackson b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/concert-magician-recalls-michael-jacksons-final-hours-2009266/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Concert Magician Recalls Michael Jackson&#8217;s Final Hours"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

He just wanted to know how she was doing because he still cared about her as a friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe Charlie's Angels star wed the Six Million Dollar Man star in 1973, and although they were married for nine years, they were separated in 1979. When Fawcett was first diagnosed with anal cancer in 2006, Majors tried to contact her indirectly.\r\n\r\nRemember those stars who died last year\r\n\r\n\"He didn't feel like he could reach out to her himself -- it had just been too long, but he still cared about her deeply,\" the source tells Us. \"He would send funny messages to her through friends, and she would do the same, and it was very sweet.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the star's cancer came back, it had been 23 years since she and Majors had spoken.\r\n\r\nSee photos of today's top news stories\r\n\r\n\"This past February, her birthday, he decided to call her for the first time. They spoke for the first time in 23 years,\" the source tells Us. \"They had a 40-minute phone conversation about her life, and the cancer and it was such a lovely moment for the two of them. I guess it was a very good conversation. They joked, and they got a little bit emotional.\"\r\n\r\nThe source adds: \"I think it was good given the current situation [for] closure, otherwise they never would've spoken again. I think he always wanted to talk to her again, but he was just afraid to speak to her before.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Fawcett never married again after her divorce from Majors, she had been dating longtime boyfriend Ryan O'Neal for nearly 30 years.\r\n\r\nO'Neal proposed to her countless times, but she always said no until last week when she agreed to marry him. She died a few days later on Thursday.\r\n\r\nSee Us' photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\r\n\r\nThe source tells Us that although they had each moved on, their brief reunion meant a lot to

The singer&apos;s death was palpable across the world. Hundreds left scrap books, flowers and candles outside his childhood home in Gary, Ind.\nOutside the UCLA Medical Center after Jackson&apos;s passing, hundreds began chanting, &quot;Michael! Michael!&quot; as another fan blasted &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; from an iPod dock.  \nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\n&quot;He was the first concert I ever went to! It was my birthday present when I was 6-years old,&quot; Missy Traubhill, 29, told Usmagazine.com. &quot;My mom took me and my cousin in a limo, and we went to go see Thriller. I bought a blue muscle T-shirt with him on the front. He was in his little black pants, his skinny little black pants and white socks and black shoes. It was my best birthday memory of my life.&quot;\nDionica Bel, 25, recalled that Jackson&apos;s HIStory was her first album.  &quot;I wanted to dance like him, to sing like him,&quot; she said. &quot;I, to this day, have not stopped trying to moonwalk. He will always be one of the premiere reasons I fell in love with the kind of music I listen to today. He is his own genre. There would be no Justin Timberlake, there would be no Usher, there would be none of those pop artists today, if not for the ground work that Michael Jackson laid out for them.&quot;  \nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\nOutside NYC&apos;s Apollo Theater late Thursday, fans remembered Jackson as well.  &quot;What really touched everybody so much out here is knowing that we lost a great person,&quot; Conway Murray, 39, told Us. &quot;It&apos;s sad, but it&apos;s a great moment to see everybody out here together as one, to share the legacy of Michael Jackson.&quot;\nWearing a bright yellow Michael Jackson T-shirt featuring four printed pictures of the singer&apos;s face, Latifa Salaam, 54, told Us she was &quot;horrified&quot; when she heard the news of his passing.  &quot;I jumped up. I said, &apos;No!&apos; But it was true,&quot; she said. &quot;So I grabbed the phone and called my daughter, everybody. Everybody heard. I called my sister, called my cousin. They were crying on the phone.&quot;\nAdded Jasmine Watson, 19: &quot;I came out here because I heard the commotion and wanted to be a part of the memorial. It&apos;s beautiful. Here we get to see everyone come together and be together to remember him. I don&apos;t think there will ever be another King of Pop.&quot;  \nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\nIn NYC&apos;s Times Square, a crowd gathered on Broadway and 44th Street outside the MTV studios. An ABC News banner read, &quot;Michael Jackson, King of Pop, Dead at 50.&quot;  At one point, a bus drove down Seventh Avenue blasting &quot;Billie Jean.&quot; Crowds cheered.\nStephanie Defeo, 34, told Us: &quot;I&apos;m heartbroken. You can say Michael Jackson anywhere in the world and people will understand. I can&apos;t believe he&apos;s dead.

But critics said even Jackman -- who opened the show with a musical tribute spoofing this year&apos;s best picture nominees -- couldn&apos;t save the dull, overformatted awards show. (A preliminary measurement of the nation&apos;s biggest markets shows ratings for this year&apos;s Academy Awards went up 6 percent over last year.)\r\n\r\nNew York&apos;s Daily News praised his energy but added that making the three-hour ceremony seem lively &quot;would have required powers beyond those of Wolverine.&quot;  &quot;Jackman did his best.

However, according to Reuters, some are questioning whether it&apos;s right to celebrate a model who was the subject of last year&apos;s biggest cocaine scandal. In September, 2005, photographs of the 32-year-old model allegedly snorting cocaine appeared on the front page of The Daily Mirror.   &#xA0; Though the model was never charged over the allegations, critics and drug charities are wondering what kind of message the award is sending to aspiring fashionistas. &quot;I think it&apos;s a bad reflection on the world of fashion,&quot; said Jane Ennis, editor of the British celebrity magazine Now. &quot;The fact that she has become an even bigger icon since getting into all this trouble is fantastically decadent. Sometimes commercial interests should be set aside to look at the wider picture.&quot; George Ruston, director of Hope UK, a drug education charity in Britain, pronounced the award &quot;unhelpful&quot; and said that advertisers were as much to blame as Moss. &#xA0; But he added that for every young person who looks up to Moss as a role model, many do not, and the problems of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis abuse are worse than that of cocaine. &#xA0; &quot;She&apos;s become a bigger name since the scandal and anyone who affiliates himself with her name will reap the publicity,&quot; aid Bryan Roberts, analyst at London trend spotting agency Planet Retail. &#xA0; Moss was originally dropped from campaigns by H&amp;M, Chanel and Burberry, but made a surprise comeback that has her featured in at least 18 major campaigns this season, including Louis Vuitton, Virgin Mobile, and Calvin Klein. Industry experts say she is earning more now than she did before the scandal broke.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Moss", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-moss/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Fashion Award Gives Hope to Snappily Dressed Alleged Cokeheads Everywhere", "datePublished": "2006-11-03T14:08:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:15+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 315, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#respond"]}], "description": "Fashion Award Gives Hope to Snappily Dressed Alleged Cokeheads Everywhere"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/", "name": "Fashion Award Gives Hope to Snappily Dressed Alleged Cokeheads Everywhere", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2006-11-03T14:08:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:15+00:00", "description": "Fashion Award Gives Hope to Snappily Dressed Alleged Cokeheads Everywhere", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Moss_blog", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-award-gives-hope-to-snappily-dressed-alleged-cokeheads-everywhere-2006311/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Fashion Award Gives Hope to Snappily Dressed Alleged Cokeheads Everywhere"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

So I&apos;m keenly aware of things not being accessible to people, especially to women and especially when it comes to fashion.&quot;\r\nDiversity was also at the forefront of Parker&apos;s mind while she was designing her collection.\r\n&quot;What appealed to me about this is the idea of making fashion accessible to all women in this country despite their economic status, their age, their size, their ethnic background, their shape, their anything. And I think it&apos;s sort of just democratization of fashion that I really love.&quot;\r\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Parker, whose designs have been criticized for being too &quot;junior&apos;s section,&quot; admits that the line isn&apos;t necessarily a reflection of her personal style.\r\n&quot;There&apos;s a lot of stuff from this line that other women will wear better then me, that actually suits them better. That&apos;s the thing about fashion, you can&apos;t just do what you want to wear. You have to think about other sizes, shapes and colors of women.&quot;\r\nMeanwhile, the second round of negotiations for a Sex and the City movie continues apace.     After the hit HBO series took its final bow in 2004, there was discussion of a movie, but negotiations ended, reportedly because of feuding between Kim Cattrall and the rest of the cast, which includes Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon.\r\n&quot;I feel more hopeful this time, but there still remains so much stuff, simple, logistical things to be done and hammered out,&quot; Parker told Lauer.\r\nParker reiterated to ET that talks have been hitting some snags, but not due to strife among cast members.\r\n&quot;This is a very complicated puzzle to put back - not for reason that people speculate about because as far as I know all of the actresses want to be together again for this movie.&quot;    She added, &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful idea to ponder and I&apos;m not being cagey but it&apos;s a complicated affair to get that show up and running for a finite period of time.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sarah-jessica-parker-talks-fashion-isexi-movie-200786/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Cynthia Nixon", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/cynthia-nixon/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Cattrall", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kim-cattrall/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kristin Davis", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kristin-davis/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Matt Lauer", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/matt-lauer/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jessica Parker", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/sarah-jessica-parker/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sarah-jessica-parker-talks-fashion-isexi-movie-200786/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sarah-jessica-parker-talks-fashion-isexi-movie-200786/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Sarah Jessica Parker Talks Fashion, Sex Movie", "datePublished": "2007-06-08T14:36:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:18+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sarah-jessica-parker-talks-fashion-isexi-movie-200786/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 520, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sarah-jessica-parker-talks-fashion-isexi-movie-200786/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sarah-jessica-parker-talks-fashion-isexi-movie-200786/#respond"]}], "description": "Actress Sarah Jessica Parker hasn't just been resting in her Manolo Blahniks during the three years since Sex and the City went off the air.

That said, the facts are the facts.&quot;\r\nHe adds: &quot;He&apos;s not the guy I would pick for my sister.&quot;\r\nLook back at Jon and Kate through the years\r\nIn the new Us Weekly, Jason -- who was not paid for his interview -- went on the record about the liaison, detailing Jon&apos;s trips to the Reading, Pennsylvania, home he shares with his sister (SEE VIDEO). (TLC was asked twice by Us Weekly to comment on the story and refused; Deanna also declined to comment multiple times before publication.)\r\nSee more unforgettable celeb scandals\r\nOf Deanna&apos;s statement to People.com, Jason adds: &quot;I noticed that in both her and Jon&apos;s recent comments, that neither of them addresses the fact that he was sleeping over at our house and was videotaped leaving our house at 7:30 in the morning.&quot;   &quot;Neither of them addresses why she was photographed in a bikini in his front yard while Kate was out of town. It is what it is. I have no reason to lie,&quot; he continues. &quot;I only want the best for my sister.&quot; (Jason told the new issue of Us Weekly that Deanna &quot;...is obviously worried about her career and reputation...and is partly hurt by [Jon] trying to deny [their affair], and partly like an idiot for not realizing what was going on sooner.&quot;)\r\nSee the ugliest celebs splits of all time\r\nAs for Deanna&apos;s accusations today against her brother for being &quot;very shady&quot; and &quot;having no job&quot; and a &quot;criminal background,&quot; Jason Hummel -- a full-time student at Reading Area Community College - was candid about his history in the new issue of Us Weekly. &quot;I have a bad past and I&apos;m not proud of it,&quot; he told the magazine. &quot;I was selling drugs. I didn&apos;t get a jail sentence, I&apos;m on probation. When I made my mistake, I was the same age as my sister is now, making her mistake. Hopefully she can learn from it.&quot;  (He is 29, Deanna is 23.)\r\nSee more controversial celeb couples\r\nMeanwhile, David Reitnauer -- a security guard at a Pennsylvania motel -- has come forth, telling RadarOnline.com that he also saw Jon kiss a woman who fits the description of Deanna at Legends Lounge on April 19. (Jon has denied kissing Deanna at the club. He also denied that he wasn&apos;t wearing his wedding ring, even though photos clearly show him with no band on his left hand.)   Jon appeared &quot;heavily intoxicated&quot; that night, Reitnauer said, and called Deanna &quot;babe,&quot; which Us Weekly reported last week. Hummel has claimed she was driving Gosselin&apos;s car because she is into cars.   Asked if Jon and Deanna&apos;s kiss seemed romantic, Reitnauer said, &quot;yes,&quot; and added that Jon seemed &quot;very startled&quot; when people noticed him.  It&apos;s not the first time Jon has acted strangely at a nightclub. In February, he was photographed partying with co-eds at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. In the current issue of Ladies&apos; Home Journal, he said, &quot;I always thought I would be, like, 54 years old and marry a 19-year-old or something.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Deanna Hummel Brother: &#8220;I Have No Reason to Lie&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-05-06T20:44:46+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:50+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 653, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#respond"]}], "description": "\"He's not the guy I would pick for my sister,\" he says, as a club security guard confirms seeing Jon Gosselin and Deanna kiss"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/", "name": "Deanna Hummel Brother: \"I Have No Reason to Lie\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-06T20:44:46+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:50+00:00", "description": "\"He's not the guy I would pick for my sister,\" he says, as a club security guard confirms seeing Jon Gosselin and Deanna kiss", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Gosselin b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/deanna-hummel-brother-i-have-no-reason-to-lie-200965/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Deanna Hummel Brother: &#8220;I Have No Reason to Lie&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

The law firm was hired to make sure the police investigation is conducted properly.&quot;\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, Murray&apos;s spokeswoman Miranda Sevcik added that the doctor &quot;helped identify the circumstances around the death of the pop icon and clarified some inconsistencies. Investigators say the doctor is in no way a suspect and remains a witness to this tragedy.&quot;\nMurray has been in Los Angeles since Jackson&apos;s death and plans to stay here until his cooperation is no longer needed, the rep added.  \nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nQuestions continue to grow about Murray&apos;s involvement in Jackson&apos;s life.  Murray -- who reportedly is licensed in California, Nevada and Texas and has an office in Houston -- had treated Jackson for three years.\nTwo weeks ago -- around the time Murray reportedly announced he was shutting down his private practice -- Jackson requested that Murray be with him, according to reports. He was then hired by AEG Live, which was producing Jackson&apos;s upcoming London shows.\nAccording to various media reports, Jackson was injected with the narcotic painkiller Demerol shortly before he went into cardiac arrest. Murray had performed CPR on him when paramedics arrived and accompanied the singer in an ambulance to the UCLA Medical Center, where the King of Pop was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. PST Thursday.  \nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\nInvestigative reporter Diane Dimond -- who has covered Michael Jackson for years -- said on CBS&apos; The Early Show Saturday Edition: &quot;If he was the only doctor on the scene and, as we heard in the 911 call, worked on Michael Jackson for quite awhile before they called 911, he may be culpable of something.&quot;\nThe official autopsy, conducted on Friday, failed to determine what killed Jackson. Toxicology test results, which could show the drugs present in Jackson&apos;s system, could take up to six weeks.\nOn Saturday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the Jackson family wants answers.   &quot;They [the Jacksons] didn&apos;t know the doctor. ... He should have met with the family, given them comfort on the last hours of their son,&quot; he said at a press conference.\nIn a quest to find answers, a second autopsy on the performer&apos;s body was performed Saturday by a private pathologist hired by the Jackson family, according to TMZ.com and The Los Angeles Times.

I have a good brain on me, but I&apos;ve never really used it when it came to making decisions about love, which has been a blessing and a curse.&quot;  \nSee the wackiest romances of 2008.\nShe continues, &quot;I definitely have been foolish. I&apos;ve made apologies to people I needed to, but I can&apos;t apologize to people I don&apos;t know for things they don&apos;t understand.&quot;  \nCan you believe these couples hooked up?\nShe defends herself when asked if she is &quot;sexually manipulative.&quot;\n&quot;I&apos;m supposed to be this complete slapper, that&apos;s my reputation,&quot; she says. &quot;But actually I was in a relationship from 19 to 21 with Dave [Neville]; 21 to 24 with Jude [Law, who cheated on her with his kids&apos; nanny]; then 25 to 26 with Rhys [Ifan], and then Balthazar.&quot;\n&quot;And then a few dalliances, three months here and there, but I&apos;ve never been like a shagger,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ve actually been kind of single for the past year. I&apos;ve had somebody on the end of the phone maybe, but I haven&apos;t been living with anyone or been in a proper relationship, and it&apos;s been really great.&quot;\n&quot;I&apos;m completely on my own,&quot;

As you can imagine, this is very hard. All together there were five of us that had the Carradine name. David had a lot of admiration for his father as an actor, and his mother he loved very dearly. We have all been close and we all love each other. There has never been any animosity or negative tension. Everyone did well in their own fields.   David is the greatest maverick. He was a maverick from the beginning. I remember when we went to private school, back in the &apos;40s.  A school for boys, everybody had to take a shower before dinner. David never liked to do the conventional and he refused, and they ended up taking him forcibly and putting him in the shower. I remember that.\r\nWhat is your favorite memory of him? This is not a favorite memory, but, you know. I remember in one instance when he had made an unfortunate decision during one of his relationships. David realized what he had done wasn&apos;t the wisest thing to do. His form of penance was to sleep on top of his grand piano, with no cushions and no blanket for a month.\r\nSee Us Weekly&apos;s photo tribute to stars who have gone too soon\r\nWhat was he most passionate about? He was definitely his own individual and guarded fiercely his own viewpoints. He was an idealist in many ways. He got a hold of kung fu, as we know. He was chosen by Jerry Thorpe who saw him on a Broadway play called Royal Hunt to the Sun. Jerry proposed the part in the Kung Fu series. He made a commitment to only do three years no matter how good or bad it was. He probably could have done it a little longer.   He one time said to me, &apos;Bruce, I would die for my beliefs.&apos; He got into more than one fight with directors. Once there was a director that was being unkind to a member of the crew, and David told him to stop. They got into it.\r\nDid he have a lot of things he struggled with in life? He made a few wrong turns in his life. We all make wrong turns in life. We all have. But, being a celebrity it sometimes got pretty public. He admitted and declared publicly that he was arrogant, but he didn&apos;t brag. He was very proud. When you become an actor, you put yourself out on the front line. You&apos;re subject to rejection. It&apos;s very difficult on the spirit.   Our father one time said, &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2DC;If you can be anything else, don&apos;t be an actor.&apos; He meant, you have to be driven so much to be an actor. When he left kung fu, he later said, &apos;Bruce, I&apos;ve lost a lot of opportunity in Hollywood because of my insensitivities and my arrogance. I realize that now.&apos; He said that like 15 to 20 years ago. Like all of us, he struggled with his demons, but they were larger than life in many instances. Being that his life as an actor was larger than life.\r\nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\r\nWhat type of father was he? BC: He was on a talk show 25 years ago, and they asked him if he was a good father. He said, &apos;No, I&apos;m just a father.&apos; I think the problem with actors, especially when they reach those heights ... David, I think he did what he could. Some of these people are so complex and so absorbed in their own lives, they have to constantly prepare for their next part -- trying to figure out how to get a part and how to survive. I think it&apos;s difficult for someone like that to be a father. They&apos;re gone on shoots. They reach the peaks of success of achievement, and during the hard times they reach the depths of despair.\r\nWhat do you know about his death at this point? Honestly, I only know what I read. I don&apos;t know any particulars. The fact that they said his hands were tied behind his back was rather suspicious. I actually got a call from a radio station in Colombia this morning.

County Coroner, the L.A. District Attorney and the L.A. Police Department,&quot; the family told Usmagazine.com in a statement on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe homicide ruling makes it likely criminal charges will be brought against Conrad Murray, the physician who admitted he administered a powerful anesthetic propofol the morning he died. Detectives have been investigating whether Murray&apos;s decision to administer Jackson propofol outside a hospital and as a sleep aid would be classified as negligence for an involuntary manslaughter charge.\r\n&quot;The family looks forward to the day that justice can be served,&quot; the statement continued.\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles coroner&apos;s office found lethal levels of propofol in Jackson&apos;s body after he died, according to a search warrant affidavit unsealed in a Houston court Monday.\r\nThe official coroner&apos;s report is sealed at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department due to the ongoing investigation.\r\n\r\nIn July, one week after Los Angeles police confirmed that investigators had not ruled out homicide, the King of Pop&apos;s older sister, La Toya Jackson, first revealed her suspicions.\r\n&quot;I believe Michael was murdered,&quot; she had said. &quot;I felt that from the start. Not just one person was involved, rather it was a conspiracy of people. He was surrounded by a bad circle. Michael was a very meek, quiet, loving person. People took advantage of that.

My decision, after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me, the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy,&quot; she explained.\r\nApplegate, the 36-year-old star who will return to work on her ABC sitcom Samantha Who? in mid-September, is now &quot;absolutely 100 percent clear and clean&quot; of cancer and planning reconstructive surgery.\r\n&quot;I&apos;m going to have cute boobs &apos;til I&apos;m 90, so there&apos;s that,&quot; she joked. &quot;I&apos;ll have the best boobs in the nursing home. I&apos;ll be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table.&quot;\r\nThe decision was an emotional one.\r\n&quot;Sometimes, you know, I cry,&quot; she said. &quot;And sometimes I scream. And I get really angry. And I get really upset, you know, into wallowing in self-pity sometimes. And I think that it&apos;s all part of the healing.&quot;\r\nApplegate said she gained insight into the disease from her mom, Nancy Priddy, a repeat breast cancer survivor.\r\n&quot;She&apos;s been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support, and just telling me that I was going to be OK,&quot; she said. &quot;And I knew I was going to be OK. I&apos;ve watched her. I&apos;ve watched her have a mastectomy, and then I&apos;ve watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy,&quot; Applegate added. &quot;I&apos;ve watched this woman survive both those things.

The 22-year-old -- who was spotted holding hands with the newly single father of eight in St. Tropez over the weekend -- was picked up by cops outside an Indiana University dorm in 2005. (She was a student at the Bloomington, Ind. campus.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Jerry Minger, the communications officer at the IU Police Department, Glassman and five friends were hanging out in a parking lot at 3:18 a.m. on Oct. 2, 2005. A cop spotted the group &quot;passing a pipe back and forth, which is consistent with marijuana,&quot; Minger tells Us.\r\n\r\nAll six people were patted down and arrested for a variety of charges, Minger says. Glassman was arrested for possession of marijuana because she had two plastic baggies in her handbag that later tested positive for THC. One bag contained one gram, the other, 2 grams.  The case was settled outside of court, Minger says. A judgment was withheld. She paid fines and court costs and was put on probation.  \r\n", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mug.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Hailey Glassman", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/hailey-glassman/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "See Mugshot of Jon Gosselin&#8217;s New Girlfriend", "datePublished": "2009-07-13T16:37:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-10-29T17:08:39+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 280, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mug.jpg?w=800&h=450&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#respond"]}], "description": "22-year-old Hailey Glassman was arrested for drug possession in 2005"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/", "name": "See Mugshot of Jon Gosselin's New Girlfriend", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mug.jpg?w=800&h=450&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-13T16:37:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-10-29T17:08:39+00:00", "description": "22-year-old Hailey Glassman was arrested for drug possession in 2005", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mug.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mug.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Mug", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/see-mugshot-of-jon-gosselins-new-girlfriend-2009137/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "See Mugshot of Jon Gosselin&#8217;s New Girlfriend"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

In fact, she even reveals the secret to avoiding the pressure to stay thin in Hollywood: Throw out the scale! &quot;It makes you kind of crazy,&quot; she says.\r\nSee interview highlights below as Heigl, 28, who is set to marry her fiance, singer Josh Kelley, in October, gets candid about falling in love and where she sees herself in 10 years.\r\nOn what prompted her to publicly chastise Isaiah Washington:&#xA0;&quot;At the time, I was a girl whose best friend had been hurt. I was mad, I&apos;d had a glass or two of champagne, and an interviewer asked me about it. Later, when I watched it on the news, I thought, I&apos;m totally going to get in trouble for this. I knew I wasn&apos;t playing the political game, the network wants us to promote a healthy, happy environment, and I&apos;m usually all for that, but that particular incident really infuriated me, and I couldn&apos;t hold my tongue. I think it&apos;s really pathetic there&apos;s still so much bigotry in 2007, and I would speak out again if the situation arose.&quot;&#x9D;\r\nOn whether it felt weird pretending to be pregnant:&#xA0;&quot;No, because the prosthetic belly felt so fake. Plus, my character was this super-in-shape reporter, so I had to lose ten pounds for the role. When I do get pregnant, I highly doubt Ill be one of those women who don&apos;t look pregnant from behind, I&apos;ll be that chick who looks pregnant from her ankles up.&quot;\r\nOn whether it was hard to lose weight for the role:&#xA0;&quot;It was awful! I remember once reading an article about Jessica Alba,&#xA0;who is the most beautiful, most in-shape person alive and how committed she was to her regimen. And I thought, There is no way in hell that will ever be me. I can&apos;t only eat fish and vegetables or work out seven days a week. Then suddenly I was that person and I was shocked. But I could never maintain it. I like food too much!&#xA0;\r\nOn how she ignores the pressure in Hollywood to stay thin:&#xA0;&quot;When I see some of the people who are glorified in magazines these days, who are so thin it&apos;s bordering on sickness, I just feel exhausted. I would hate to think that young girls in high schools across America think that&apos;s what they&apos;re supposed to look like.&quot;&#xA0;\r\nOn who she thinks has a healthy body in Hollywood:&#xA0;&quot;Jennifer Aniston and Halle Berry are both in amazing shape. They look phenomenal but they don&apos;t look sick. Then there&apos;s Kate Winslet: She&apos;s confident, beautiful, talented and sexy and she owns it. Early in my career, I read an interview she gave about how the industry wanted her to lose weight; she basically gave them the finger and said no. I remember thinking, I can do that too. I don&apos;t have to look like one of these genetically superior people in order to work.&quot;&#xA0;\r\nOn when she knew Josh Kelley was The One:&#xA0;&quot;We definitely had chemistry at first sight. In the beginning, I was a little intimidated because I thought I was more into him than he was into me. But I was tired of playing games, tired of playing it cool, tired of trying to remain in control of my relationships. So I was honest about how I felt, he was honest right back, and within a month and a half I was completely in love with this guy.&quot;\r\nOn growing up Mormon:&#xA0;&quot;I am really supportive of the Mormon church and so profoundly grateful for the childhood I had. It&apos;s hard work to grow and change and be honest with yourself about your mistakes, and I think that the Mormons handle that beautifully. The faith I grew up with has influenced every decision I&apos;ve made in my life, well except for the bad ones. [laughs]\r\nOn coping with the death of her brother who died in a car accident when she was seven: &quot;I think about what our lives would be like now if he were still alive: what he&apos;d be doing, where he&apos;d be living, whether I&apos;d see him often, whether he&apos;d have kids. These are the things you think about when someone dies, all the potential that never was.

I&apos;m like, &apos;Come on, can&apos;t we just be boyfriend and girlfriend?&apos;&quot;\r\nHer ideal guy?\r\n&quot;Firstly, he has to be stronger than I am mentally. And he can&apos;t be jealous because I&apos;m a very touchy-feely person,&quot; she says. &quot;And he&apos;d need to be able to tell me both yes and no. I&apos;ll probably end up with someone who&apos;s a bit older, and a few steps ahead of me -- I want someone I can learn from.&quot;\r\nPerry admits she still has insecurities.\r\n&quot;One is that I have acne scars,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m self-conscious about that, so sometimes I wear too much makeup to cover them up.

It also is the first time the actress, 44, had to shoot a nude scene.\n&quot;Sadly, my first and last nude scene got laughs, so I had to be very secure with that,&quot; she said Sunday at the film&apos;s press junket. &quot;It was all about choreography. I mean, literally when you read it on the page, you saw it, and then you realized, &apos;OK, there is no way to shoot this unless you are buck naked!&apos; Then I went, &apos;Go to the gym, cut out the carbs!&apos;&quot;  \nSee stars who have no problem showing a little skin\nThe scene -- which involves a naked run-in scene with costar Ryan Reynolds -- took three days to film and over a dozen takes.  &quot;I&apos;m glad it made people laugh,&quot; she said. &quot;Shooting it was odd. There are things stuck to areas that generally you don&apos;t have things [stuck to]. I mean, you have things covering [your body], but not stuck to it. And then they got unstuck, and oddly we didn&apos;t care because we were so tired.&quot;\nAdded Reynolds, &quot;Yeah, at that point, shame is gone completely. The weirdest part is calling your mom nude on set: &apos;Hey, just checking in!&apos;&quot;  \nSee photos of Ryan Reynolds and other stars sweating it out at the gym \nThe Proposal is Bullock&apos;s first romantic comedy since 2005&apos;s Miss Congeniality 2: Armed &amp; Fabulous.  &quot;I stopped doing them,&quot; she said. &quot;They are terrible, they are bad. They are not funny, so they shouldn&apos;t be a romantic comedy and most of the time they are not romantic. So they shouldn&apos;t be called a romantic comedy.

That&apos;ll be 10 bucks, sucker,&quot; continues the Herald critic.\r\nAdds CNN: &quot;Perhaps inspired by another Cohen creation, Ali G, he sets out to make a celebrity interview show -- but sadly, the only dupes ignorant enough to participate are American Idol judges and presidential candidates [Ron Paul is  inadvertently cast in a sex tape].&quot;\r\nThe New York Times calls Cohen a &quot;brilliant slapstick artist and a master of voices -- Bruno&apos;s mock-German and scrambled American idioms are in some ways even more crazily spot-on than Borat&apos;s gibberish.&quot;\r\nSee photos of famous funny faces.\r\nBut the paper isn&apos;t won over by the movie.\r\n&quot;In spite of Mr. Baron Cohen&apos;s...high-level skills and keen low-comic instincts, Bruno is a lazy piece of work that panders more than it provokes,&quot; writes critic A.O. Scott.\r\nThe The Hollywood Reporter calls Cohen&apos;s ambushes &quot;too often...mean-spirited.\r\n&quot;We sense, as we never did with Borat, the comic behind the character. Especially when his accent keeps changing -- from an unconvincing Austrian to his own British and even to a whisper of Borat himself,&quot; it writes.\r\nBut Entertainment Weekly grades the film &quot;A-&quot; and says it&apos;s &quot;funnier than Borat.&quot;\r\n&quot;The entire film is in seriously questionable taste, and there will, of course, be debates about what&apos;s staged and what&apos;s not. Those looking for purity in satire should stay away. Yet there&apos;s a vision at work in Bruno -- the movie is a toxic dart aimed at the spangly new heart of American hypocrisy: our fake-tolerant, fake-charitable, fake-liberated-yet-still madly-closeted fame culture. Bruno ends on a note of scandalously funny out-and-proud triumph.&quot;  \r\nVariety bets the flick will open to high box office figures, calling it &quot;undeniably funny, outrageous and boundary-pushing.&quot;\r\nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\r\nBut the controversial content will turn off some moviegoers, the magazine points out.\r\n&quot;There is also a pronounced nasty streak to the innumerable provocations staged by the title character that curdles the laughs and wears out the ... Austrian fashionista&apos;s welcome within the picture&apos;s brief 82-minute running time,&quot; Variety wrote.\r\nTell Us: Will you see Bruno this weekend?", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Sacha Baron Cohen", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/sacha-baron-cohen/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Bruno Draws Mixed Reviews From Critics", "datePublished": "2009-07-10T21:23:15+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:40+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 513, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#respond"]}], "description": "Sacha Baron Cohen's controversial comedy (out today) is called \"a lazy piece of work\" and \"brilliant\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/", "name": "Bruno Draws Mixed Reviews From Critics", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-10T21:23:15+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:40+00:00", "description": "Sacha Baron Cohen's controversial comedy (out today) is called \"a lazy piece of work\" and \"brilliant\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Sasha Baron Cohen poses during a press conference ahead of the Australian premiere of 'Bruno: The Movie' on June 29, 2009 in Sydney, Australia.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bruno-draws-mixed-reviews-from-critics-2009107/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Bruno Draws Mixed Reviews From Critics"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Judy and Larry Vardon, weighed down by a mortgage payment that has almost doubled since the makeover, worries the house could face foreclosure.\r\nFind our more about the curse of reality TV.\r\nWhen host Ty Pennington arrived at the Vardon&apos;s home with the Extreme Home Makeover crew four years ago, he promised to give them a home that would help them better accommodate their blind, autistic son. The episode, which aired Nov. 6, 2004, set a ratings record when millions of viewers tuned in to see the tranformation of the 980 square-foot home in Oak Park, Michigan.  In addition to mortgage payments, the couple also owes $20,000 for autism treatment -- which isn&apos;t covered by their medical insurance -- for their 16-year-old son, Lance. Larry Vardon also worries that he&apos;ll keep his job at Chrysler LLC&apos;s Sterling Heights stamping plant, as the company -- along with other Detroit automakers -- is on the brink of bankruptcy.   &quot;I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m going to lose my house now,&quot; Judy Vardon, using sign language through an interpreter, told The Macomb Daily of Mount Clemens. &quot;This house really belongs to Lance. This is his environment. He can&apos;t speak out for himself, and I hope we can save this house.&quot;  After the makeover, which included installing flat-screen monitors for Lance, the couple refinanced the mortgage. Their monthly payments went from $1,200 to $2,300.\r\nSee photos of Britney Spears&apos; new house.&#xA0;\r\n&quot;We didn&apos;t have bad spending habits,&quot; Judy said. &quot;My husband got laid off for a time, and insurance wouldn&apos;t cover Lance&apos;s autism therapy and some other things like his vision and special dental work.&quot;  The couple is now working with a nonprofit group that aids families in crisis to help them negotiate a lower mortgage rate.  &quot;We&apos;re a close family that loves each other,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I feel that I was given this life to show others that you can face these challenges.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Extreme Makeover Family Faces Home Foreclosure", "datePublished": "2008-12-09T18:43:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:30+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 374, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#respond"]}], "description": "The deaf couple who won a home makeover four years ago fear they may face foreclosure"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/", "name": "Extreme Makeover Family Faces Home Foreclosure", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2008-12-09T18:43:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:30+00:00", "description": "The deaf couple who won a home makeover four years ago fear they may face foreclosure", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Ty Pennington attends the grand opening of ADHD on August 15, 2007 in Venice Beach, California.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/iextreme-makeoveri-family-faces-home-foreclosure-2008912/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Extreme Makeover Family Faces Home Foreclosure"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

He is now dating 19-year-old twins Karissa and Kristina Shannon.\r\n&quot;I&apos;m not going to have multiple girlfriends -- not at the same time,&quot; 18-year-old Marston Hefner says in the January issue of Playboy &quot;I can&apos;t imagine that.&quot;\r\nHis brother, 17-year-old Cooper Hefner, begs to differ.\r\n&quot;I can imagine doing that. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an odd thing to do,&quot; he says. &quot;You date around to try to find a connection with some girl.&quot;\r\nCooper admits he&apos;s &quot;already gotten in trouble&quot; and had the &quot;revolving-door conversation&quot; with his mother, former Playmate Kimberley Conrad.\r\n&quot;One girl comes in the front door while the other one gets pushed out the back,&quot; Cooper says, adding that his mother has told him, &quot;&apos;We do not have a revolving door in this house!&apos; She&apos;s all about one girlfriend at a time,&quot; he says.\r\n\r\nCooper also says growing up in the Playboy mansion is overrated.\r\n&quot;They don&apos;t get it when you say, &apos;There&apos;s nothing to do there,&apos;&quot; he says. &quot;But when you live here and come here every single day, you see the same things. Anybody else would be like, &apos;Let&apos;s go see monkeys!&apos; But I don&apos;t want to see monkeys,&quot; he goes on. &quot;I&apos;d rather go bowling than play with monkeys.&quot;\r\nThough their dad is adored by many, they view him as a bad dancer.\r\n&quot;He is cool out there because his moves are so uncool,&quot; Marston says. &quot;He&apos;s a disco inferno from another planet!&quot;  Adds Cooper, &quot;He&apos;s utterly confused, moving his body -- the fast shuffles, the crazy elbows -- as if he&apos;s not sure what he&apos;s doing. And all these girls on both sides are freaking on him. It should be awkward, but it isn&apos;t for him. It sort of works. Nobody alive can dance like him.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo do the boys ever want to run Playboy one day?\r\n&quot;I definitely want to be involved with the company,&quot; Cooper says. &quot;If I were to take over the company or have a say in what&apos;s going on, I&apos;d want the girls to be presented more as they were in the pictorials back in the 1950s and 1960s -- kind of artsy, classy. I would like to bring back that retro-class feel.&quot;\r\n", "isPartOf": {"@id":

Times reports.  \nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories\nThe news comes one day after federal drug agents and Los Angeles Police Department investigators raided Dr. Conrad Murray&apos;s Houston medical clinic and a public storage unit rented by him.\nAccording to the warrant filed in Harris County District Court, authorities were looking for &quot;items constituting evidence of the offense of manslaughter that tend to show that Dr. Conrad Murray committed the said criminal offense.&quot;\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s pill addiction began\nAmong the items seized from the storage unit were two computer hard drives, a Medical Board certificate, letters to a former employee, a list of contacts and papers pertaining to his practice. Among those is a &quot;suspension notice Doctor&apos;s Hospital&quot; and &quot;papers regarding incomplete chart Doctor&apos;s Hospital.&quot;\nAuthorities also seized letters from the Internal Revenue Service, Texas Department of Public Safety controlled substance registration and public records from the Texas controller.\nSee 32 photos from inside Michael Jackson&apos;s Staples Center memorial\nAn administrative assistant at Doctor&apos;s Hospital in Houston said Murray is currently suspended from practicing at the hospital. She said, however, that the offense was &quot;very much&quot; routine and minor and &quot;probably had something to do with a chart that needs to be signed.&quot;\nAn inventory of items taken in the search of Murray&apos;s office included vials of two drugs: 27 tablets of phentermine, a prescription appetite suppressant; and one tablet of clonazepam, a muscle relaxant.\nAuthorities also confiscated a computer, a Rolodex card with Federal Express information and e-mails from one of Murray&apos;s former employees.\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years\nMurray&apos;s attorney, Ed Chernoff, said Wednesday that the doctor would cooperate with investigators.   &quot;We reviewed the warrant and remained on the premises while the search was being executed,&quot; he said.\nMurray, Chernoff added, &quot;was the last doctor standing when Michael Jackson died and it seems all the fury is directed toward him. Dr. Murray is frustrated by negative and often erroneous media reports, he has to walk around 24-7 with a bodyguard. He can&apos;t operate his practice.
