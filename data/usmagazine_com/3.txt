Sarah Palin, whom she interviewed last year: &quot;Coming here was a real no brainer! After all, I can see New Jersey from my house!&quot;\r\nLook back at the 2008 election&apos;s most embarrassing moments\r\nKidding aside, Couric told the crowd, &quot;As you head out into this daunting job market, at least you have many illustrious alumni lighting the way.&quot;  She cited Michele Obama as an example: &quot;She was class of 1985, and now she&apos;s wowing them in Washington.&quot;\r\nSee unforgettable shots of Michelle and Barack Obama&apos;s first 100 days in office\r\nCouric continued, &quot;There are a few noteworthy men who were proud to go to Princeton as well...a list that reads like a who&apos;s who of American History. James Madison, John Foster Dulles, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Malcolm Forbes, James Baker....and Lyle Menendez, who&apos;s currently serving a life sentence at the Mule Creek State Prison in California. Hey, you can&apos;t win &apos;em all!&quot;\r\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\r\n&quot;Don&apos;t be a hater,&quot; Couric later added. &quot;Princeton has taught you to think critically, to approach things with a healthy dose of skepticism ... and that&apos;s a good thing, as Martha Stewart would say. ...

This news was confusing and scary, as I lived&#xA0;alone with my father since I was 3,&quot; Bijou, 29, says in a statement to Usmagazine.com.\r\n&quot;I didn&apos;t know what to believe, and it didn&apos;t help that shortly there after Mackenzie told me it didn&apos;t happen.\r\n\r\n&quot;Mackenzie&apos;s history with our father is hers, but also clouded with 30 years of drug abuse.\r\n&quot;I hope she can come to terms &#xA0;with this and find peace,&quot; Bijou continues. &quot;The life I had with my father was very &#xA0;different. He was Mr. Mom, encouraging and loving. The man that raised &#xA0;me would never be capable of doing such things, and if he was, it is &#xA0;heartbreaking to me to think that my family would leave me alone with him.\r\n&quot;I understand Mackenzie&apos;s need to come clean with a history she feels will help others, but it&apos;s devastating to have the world watch as we try and mend broken fences, especially when the man in question isn&#x2019;t here to defend&#xA0;himself,&quot; her statement concludes.\r\n\r\nMackenzie&apos;s stepmother Michelle Phillips, 65, also slammed the story. She told Vanity Fair on Friday, &quot;I&apos;m so embarrassed &#x2014; and mad. At Oprah, at the publisher, and at Mackenzie, who should be on a psychiatrist&apos;s couch, not on TV.....&quot;\r\nShe added, &quot;Mackenzie has affected the lives of all her nieces and nephews, who are not going to school today and are staying home sobbing instead.&quot;\r\nChynna Phillips is standing behind her stepsister Mackenzie. She tells the new Us Weekly (on newsstands now): &#xA0;&quot;I have pretty much come to peace with the fact that she&apos;s written this book and that it&apos;s been a cathartic experience for her.&quot;\r\n\r\n&#xA0;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 356}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Bijou Phillips", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/bijou-phillips/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mackenzie Phillips", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/mackenzie-phillips/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Bijou Phillips: Mackenzie Told Me She Had Sex With Dad When I Was 13", "datePublished": "2009-09-25T17:05:49+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T02:00:14+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 476, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#respond"]}], "description": "She tells Us, \"It's devastating to have the world watch as we try and mend broken fences\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/", "name": "Bijou Phillips: Mackenzie Told Me She Had Sex With Dad When I Was 13", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-09-25T17:05:49+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T02:00:14+00:00", "description": "She tells Us, \"It's devastating to have the world watch as we try and mend broken fences\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 356, "caption": "1253897813_bijoux mackenzie 290"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bijoux-and-mackenzie-2009259/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Bijou Phillips: Mackenzie Told Me She Had Sex With Dad When I Was 13"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

She just brings it with her style -- she dresses for 3008 and we&apos;re all just trying to catch up! The labels she wears are so modern but sometimes they&apos;re priced in another galaxy. Come back down to earth in Kowboy and Co&apos;s $64 pair of leggings that replicates those $198 jeans she loves to wear. Shoppers beware: this look is not for everyone! I am personally not a huge fan of tie-dyed leggings or jeans for my bumps and curves so I really only advise those who have nice, fit stems and no belly bulge to do this look. Please make sure you buy the right size. I have seen too many young women lately buying and wearing the wrong size leggings, which invites roll-overs and causes body fat ripples in the wrong places with these types of pants. Also, make sure you get a good top that you can pair with it well, like a simple jersey tee. &#xA0;Celebrities (when they look good) are there for fashion ideas and inspiration on the most up-to-date trends and they own what really fits and tailors their body well. When you&apos;re trying stuff on, make sure it fits you properly!&#xA0; Being this up-to-the-minute can get very expensive if you&apos;re not wearing it right. There are several ideas here and ways to wear Kowboys and Co.&apos;s leggings. Just go with what makes you feel the most glamorous!&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Purchase information: Buy it here.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 420}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Recessionista: Go Gator", "datePublished": "2009-09-18T18:24:32+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:58:24+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 261, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": ["Celebrity Style", "Recessionista"], "articleSection": ["Star Style"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#respond"]}], "description": "Kowboys and Co. offers a chic pair of Alligator leggings for less"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/", "name": "Recessionista: Go Gator", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-09-18T18:24:32+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:58:24+00:00", "description": "Kowboys and Co. offers a chic pair of Alligator leggings for less", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 420, "caption": "1252687579_leggings 290"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/recessionista-leggings-2009189/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Recessionista: Go Gator"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp; Entertainment", "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization", "name": "Us Weekly", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/USWeekly-Logo.png?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/USWeekly-Logo.png?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1024, "height": 958, "caption": "Us Weekly"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "https://x.com/usweekly", "https://instagram.com/usweekly/", "https://www.pinterest.com/usweekly/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/UsWeekly"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#/schema/person/cd4e7b48df1eb3fa393ff33c48149918", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "description": "", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}]}]

Escapism is survival to me.&quot;\r\nSee what Johnny Depp and other stars look like as cartoons\r\nLittle Hall&apos;s Pond Cay features six different beaches, named after Depp&apos;s partner, Vanessa Paradis, and their children, Lily Rose, 10, and Jack, 7, as well as his mentors Hunter S. Thompson and Marlon Brando.  He also deemed one patch of water &quot;Heath&apos;s Place&quot; after the late actor Heath Ledger. (Depp plays an incarnation of Ledger in the fantasy movie, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, due later this year.)\r\nLook back at Heath Ledger&apos;s life\r\nThe island features several small residences, all solar-powered, and transportation consists of a fleet of green golf carts. &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever seen any place so pure and beautiful,&quot; says Depp, who headlines the July thriller Public Enemies. &quot;You can feel your pulse rate drop about 20 beats. It&apos;s instant freedom. And that rare beast-simplicity-can be had. And a little morsel of anonymity. Whenever I was getting frustrated about being &apos;novelty boy&apos; and making movies, I told myself, &apos;Calm down. I can come down here and disappear.&apos; I spent the Christmas season here with Vanessa and the kids.

(She has vaguely said they just &quot;don&apos;t go together.&quot;)\r\nSee Tori Spelling and other stars at fashion week!\r\nIn April, Candy -- who released her frank memoir Stories From Candyland a few weeks before Tori debuted her book, Mommyhood -- posted a public letter to Tori on her website, pushing for a reconciliation.\r\nBut Tori told Usmagazine.com in April, &quot;If I said one thing to my mother, it wouldn&apos;t be public because if she does intend to have a relationship with her grandchildren -- which I am totally open to -- I just would like her to approach us privately.&quot;",

She said she had signed on to the shoot the indie Barney&apos;s Version, which begins filming the same day as Eclipse, but stressed that her commitment to the film was only two weeks. Said Lefevre, &quot;Never did I fathom I would lose the role over a 10-day overlap.&quot;  \nCheck out the latest Robert Pattinson news\nBut Summit painted a different picture in the statement late Wednesday:\n&quot;We at Summit Entertainment are disappointed by Rachelle Lefevre&apos;s recent comments, which attempt to make her career choices the fault of the studio. Her decision to discuss her version of the scheduling challenges publicly has forced the studio to set the record straight and correct the facts.\n&quot;Ms. Lefevre&apos;s representatives were advised as early as April that The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was expected to start shooting in early August.\n&quot;If Ms. Lefevre was, as she describes, &apos;passionate&apos; about being part of the Twilight saga, we feel that she and her representatives would have included us in her decision to work on another film that would conflict with the shooting schedule of The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.\n\n&quot;It was not until July 20th that Summit was first informed of Ms. Lefevre&apos;s commitment to Barney&apos;s Version, a commitment we have since been advised she accepted in early June. Summit had acted in good faith that she would be available to fulfill her obligations both in terms of rehearsals and shooting availability for The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. We feel that her choice to withhold her scheduling conflict information from us can be viewed as a lack of cooperative spirit which affected the entire production.\n&quot;Furthermore, Ms. Lefevre took a role in the other film that places her in Europe during the required rehearsal time, and at least 10 days of [Eclipse]&apos;s principal photography. This period is essential for both rehearsal time with the cast and for filming at key locations that are only available during the initial part of production.  \nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\n&quot;Contrary to Ms. Lefevre&apos;s statement, it is simply untrue that the studio dismissed her over a 10-day overlap,&quot; the statement concludes. &quot;It is not about a 10-day overlap, but instead about the fact that The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is an ensemble production that has to accommodate the schedules of numerous actors while respecting the established creative vision of the filmmaker and most importantly the story.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Bryce Dallas Howard", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/bryce-dallas-howard/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rachelle Lefevre", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/rachelle-lefevre/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Twilight Studio Fires Back at Actress Rachelle Lefevre", "datePublished": "2009-07-30T13:39:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:47+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 561, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#respond"]}], "description": "Summit blames the star's \"lack of cooperative spirit\" for being recast"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/", "name": "Twilight Studio Fires Back at Actress Rachelle Lefevre", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-30T13:39:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:47+00:00", "description": "Summit blames the star's \"lack of cooperative spirit\" for being recast", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Rachelle Lefevre attends the Access Hollywood \"Stuff You Must...\" Lounge produced by On 3 Productions held at Sofitel LA on January 9, 2009 in Los Angeles, CA.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/twilight-studio-fires-back-at-actress-rachelle-lefevre-2009307/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Twilight Studio Fires Back at Actress Rachelle Lefevre"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

You know, I mean, that&apos;s hardly a makeover.&quot;  \nSee Us&apos; makeovers the year!\nThe 47-year-old debuted a $50 darker dye job last month &quot;just to tidy myself up, like any other female would have done,&quot; she says.   Boyle isn&apos;t sure she&apos;ll win Britain&apos;s Got Talent -- despite having over 100 million YouTube views of her first performance.  &quot;Well, I hope I have the chance, but at the same time, there&apos;s a lot of other talent in the competition, so I&apos;m willing to take my place with them,&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of good talent on the show.&quot;  \nSee the most controversial reality stars of all time.\nBoyle tells Winfrey she began singing at school to help her handle a learning disability.  &quot;I was kind of a slow learner at school, so getting something like singing was a good way of hiding behind that and so boosting my confidence,&quot; she says. &quot;I sang at karaokes, which most people do for fun. And I did sing at one or two occasions within the family.&quot;  But when her mother -- her No. 1 supporter -- died in 2007, she stopping singing.  &quot;After that, there was a wee period where I didn&apos;t sing,&quot; she says.   She tried out for Talent to come to terms with the loss.  &quot;You try and keep going through that pain, and that&apos;s what I tried to do with my singing. I am very slowly getting over it,&quot; she says. &quot;One of the reasons I applied for the TV show was to try to see if I could perform in front of an audience.&quot;\nCheck out the day&apos;s top news photos.\nNow she has photographers camped outside her home and even gets fan mail for her cat, Pebbles.  &quot;It all takes a bit of time to take in. I mean, these things have happened so quickly. It&apos;s pretty awesome,&quot; she says.  &quot;I think change is always very hard to come by at first, but I&apos;m really enjoying it and really enjoying every second of it,&quot; she continues. &quot;It&apos;s like a dream come true.&quot;  Simon Cowell says watching Boyle perform was &quot;one of [his] favorite moments&quot; on the show.   But now she&apos;s under &quot;tremendous pressure, tremendous scrutiny,&quot; Cowell goes on. When asked if he thinks she can win, he says, &quot;I do.  &quot;You&apos;ve got practically the whole world behind you now,&quot; Cowell told Boyle. &quot;So I want to say congratulations and wish you the best of luck.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Oprah Winfrey", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/oprah-winfrey/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Simon Cowell", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/simon-cowell/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Boyle", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/susan-boyle/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Susan Boyle Speaks Out on Makeover", "datePublished": "2009-05-11T20:02:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:51+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 529, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#respond"]}], "description": "She downplays her new look, telling Oprah her friend \"helps\" do her makeup"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/", "name": "Susan Boyle Speaks Out on Makeover", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-11T20:02:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:51+00:00", "description": "She downplays her new look, telling Oprah her friend \"helps\" do her makeup", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Boyle oprah b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/susan-boyle-speaks-out-on-makeover-2009115/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Susan Boyle Speaks Out on Makeover"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

I locked in the brightest light in the room.&quot;\nHis nearly four-year marriage to the 46-year-old actress is as strong as ever, thanks to a pact they made when they first wed.\nSee photos of Demi and Ashton&apos;s most romantic moments!\n&quot;My wife and I have an agreement in our marriage, and part of that contract is that we are going to shine our lights on each other,&quot; he says. &quot;My relationship with Demi is so solid, thank God, and we&apos;re so communicative about the way that we&apos;re feeling, that we don&apos;t allow space to come between us. I definitely believe that if you stop working at relationships, they go away.&quot;\nThe 31-year-old star wasn&apos;t always so lucky.   Before he rose to fame, he recalls early years when he was broke.  \nSee photos of more stars -- including Demi Moore&apos;s ex! -- before they were famous.\n&quot;I bought my whole family these fake watches and fake Versace pants and fake anything I could find, like fake Calvin Klein T-shirts, so I could take them home and show them how well I was doing even though I didn&apos;t have a place to live.&quot;\nPrior to meeting Moore, he even traded up for a good night&apos;s sleep.\n&quot;It was always a good thing when you hooked up with a girl and got to sleep someplace nice for the night,&quot; he says. &quot;I wasn&apos;t there to stay, but if you did hit it off with a girl, her place was always nicer than yours.&quot;\nSee photos of other romantic star couples.\nStill, Kutcher admits there&apos;s a downside to living the Hollywood life.\n&quot;Of course there is a price,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve only been back home to Iowa once in the last year and a half to see my family. I go and shoot a film and spend months away from my wife and my girls [Rumer, 20, Scout, 17, and Tallulah, 15]. And that&apos;s a price to pay. I also don&apos;t get to see my friends very often. You can&apos;t complain when you&apos;re so blessed. I get so many things that the notion of me complaining is obscene. It&apos;s absurd. It&apos;s ridiculous.&quot;\nThe former That &apos;70s Show actor and Punk&apos;d host stresses that he&apos;s the same goofball he&apos;s always been.\n&quot;I&apos;m still looking for trouble.

and had also withdrawn a claim for constructive dismissal, he said.\nSee Victoria Beckham&apos;s craziest outfits of all time\nThe judge was also told that in July 2005, The People newspaper published an article titled &quot;Beckham&apos;s Hate Calls To Nanny,&quot; which falsely stated that David had made threatening calls to Gibson.\nCan you spot Victoria Beckham&apos;s cartoon character in this gallery?\nThe paper later publicly apologized and paid libel damages to Beckham.  &quot;Ms Gibson is happy to confirm that David Beckham did not at any stage make any such telephone calls to her,&quot;

I want to be clear about that. My job is to execute and come up with some ideas, but ultimately that was Beyonce&apos;s decision.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I can only say it was a proud night for me as a manager, but more importantly as a father,&quot;

Though ABC&apos;s Web site claims he was born in Milan and raised in Connecticut, his parents, Princess Amanda Borghese and Prince Francesco Borghese, have lived in Short Hills, New Jersey, since 1979, and his permanent addresses prior to 2001 all list him as a resident of the Garden State.\r\nA source tells Radar that after discovering that Borghese speaks only &quot;menu Italian,&quot; the show&apos;s producers enrolled Borghese in an intensive Italian language course before filming began. (A spokesman for ABC denies knowledge of the course.)\r\nThe title is real, though it doesn&apos;t translate into a castle and throne (titles haven&apos;t even been recognized in Italy since 1947).\r\nThe Borghese family is said to be deeply embarrassed by Lorenzo&apos;s participation in the show, though his recent foray into the Borghese Cosmetics line hardly bolstered his pedigree.\r\nLorenzo&apos;s contribution to the family business?

He has also been linked to third grade teacher Deanna &#xA0;Hummel and former tabloid reporter Kate Major.&#xA0;\r\n&#xA0;\r\n&#xA0;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 419}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jon Gosselin&#8217;s Lawyer Slams Ex-Nanny&#8217;s Sex Claims", "datePublished": "2009-09-16T22:27:30+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T02:00:06+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 337, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#respond"]}], "description": "Stephanie Santoro says she slept with Gosselin nine times while the kids were sleeping"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/", "name": "Jon Gosselin's Lawyer Slams Ex-Nanny's Sex Claims", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-09-16T22:27:30+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T02:00:06+00:00", "description": "Stephanie Santoro says she slept with Gosselin nine times while the kids were sleeping", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 419, "caption": "1253138245_steph 290"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-lawyer-slams-sensational-tabloid-story-2009169/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Jon Gosselin&#8217;s Lawyer Slams Ex-Nanny&#8217;s Sex Claims"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on, but he needs to go to the hospital ... right away.&quot;\r\n&quot;At that point, I knew that somebody had given him something that hit the central nervous system,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;He was in trouble Sunday and he was crying out.&quot;\r\nJackson did not go to the hospital.\r\nHe died after suffering cardiac arrest.\r\nThough an official cause of death is not expected for several weeks, Lee told the AP: &quot;I don&apos;t know what happened there.

It was a very special mother-and-baby moment,&quot; the photographer told the paper. &quot;Paris was asleep in her mother&apos;s arms and looked very contented.&quot;  \nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years\nAdded the photographer, &quot;It was obvious that Debbie loved her children and there was a strong connection between them. It looked like she was treasuring every second, laughing, kissing and playing with them for about two hours.  \nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\n&quot;Michael didn&apos;t spend much time talking to Debbie during the meeting - but he was happy to watch her with the children,&quot; the shutterbug said. &quot;It was his idea to do the photos. He was already thinking ahead. He wanted the pictures so he could show the children when they were older, so they&apos;d know who their mother is.&quot;  Despite reports that Rowe plans to fight for custody of Prince, 12, and Paris, 11, she &quot;has not reached a final decision concerning the custody proceedings,&quot; her attorney Eric George told Usmagazine.com last week.\nSee photos of Michael Jackson and his kids through the years\nRowe &#x2013; who was spotted over the weekend at her Palmdale, Calif., horse farm &#x2013; has not spoken publicly about the custody proceedings, but told NBCLA&apos;s Chuck Henry in a phone conversation (that was not broadcast) last week that she wants the kids. &quot;I have no reason to doubt that what was reported from that conversation was accurately and ethically reported, but that said, it would be a distortion of the truth to allow that single snapshot of a single conversation, to stand as the truth on Debbie&apos;s position on this sensitive matter,&quot; her attorney told Us.\nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nA guardianship hearing scheduled for Monday has been postponed until July 13 at the request of attorneys for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.  Rowe wed Jackson in 1996 (he was a patient in the dermatologist&apos;s office, where she worked as a nurse). The children were born through artificial insemination. (The new issue of Us Weekly exclusively reports that children&apos;s father is Arnold Klein, Jackson&apos;s L.A.-based dermatologist and Rowe&apos;s former boss.)  After Jackson and Rowe divorced in 1999, she agreed to give up her parental rights, insisting Jackson was a good father.  On Monday, it was reported that Rowe will attend Jackson&apos;s memorial Tuesday in L.A.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Debbie Rowe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/debbie-rowe/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "New Photos Surface of Michael Jackson, Debbie Rowe Cradling Their Kids", "datePublished": "2009-07-06T14:33:07+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:30+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 514, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity Moms"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#respond"]}], "description": "The pics were the singer's idea so when \"the children were older, they'd know who their mother is\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/", "name": "New Photos Surface of Michael Jackson, Debbie Rowe Cradling Their Kids", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-06T14:33:07+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:30+00:00", "description": "The pics were the singer's idea so when \"the children were older, they'd know who their mother is\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Debbie michael b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/new-photos-surface-of-michael-jackson-debbie-rowe-cradling-their-kids-200967/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "New Photos Surface of Michael Jackson, Debbie Rowe Cradling Their Kids"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

The star announced her engagement on ABC&apos;s Good Morning America Tuesday.  &quot;Sometimes the stars align and the clouds part and everything works out the way it should,&quot; she said.

We&apos;re soooo excited!&quot;  The newly engaged couple first celebrated with their parents over dinner at Brio.  &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;He had the proposal all planned out in advance and completely surprised her,&quot; a source tells Usmagazine.com. &quot;The dinner was a surprise as well. She&apos;s so proud of him for being able to pull it off without anyone finding out!&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D;  They then continued the party with 20 friends at Cretia&apos;s restaurant that night, a staffer from the eatery tells Us.  &quot;When they walked in, everybody stood up and clapped,&quot; the staffer says, adding that Rycroft looked &quot;beaming happy.&quot;  According to the staffer, the 26-year-old Texas native and Strickland toasted with champagne and stayed until the restaurant closed at 2 a.m.  \n&#xA0;\nSee what Melissa Rycroft and all the stars wore to the 2009 Us Weekly Hollywood party.\nRycroft and her insurance agent beau began quietly dating shortly after she was proposed to and then unceremoniously dumped six weeks later by Jason Mesnick in March.  &quot;We&apos;ve been really good friends, but the timing was never right,&quot; she told Us at the time. &quot;With all this going on, he&apos;s my support system. It&apos;s funny how things happen.&quot;   Check out DWTS members&apos; amazing makeovers. Rycroft explained why they waited to announce their engagement.  &quot;Sorry we kept it a secret for a few days,&quot; she wrote on her Facebook page. &quot;We kind of thought there were more important things going on throughout the weekend, and it would be rude to make our announcement during all that.&quot;  No wedding date has been set.   &quot;They just want to enjoy their engagement for awhile,&quot; the source tells Us. &quot;She couldn&apos;t be more thrilled.&quot;  The engagement comes a week after Rycroft started her new job on ABC&apos;s Good Morning America.

Afterwards, all I could do is say &apos;I&apos;m sorry.&apos; Yeah.&quot;  But later?  &quot;We went back to our trailer and made out after the dancing scene,&quot; he quips.   \nSee photos of star PDA.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Gerard Butler", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/gerard-butler/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Aniston", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jennifer-aniston/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Gerard Butler Jokes About Marrying Jennifer Aniston", "datePublished": "2009-07-22T21:35:13+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:03+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 252, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#respond"]}], "description": "The actor says he also plans to wed \"Cameron Diaz and maybe Joan Rivers\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/", "name": "Gerard Butler Jokes About Marrying Jennifer Aniston", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-22T21:35:13+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:03+00:00", "description": "The actor says he also plans to wed \"Cameron Diaz and maybe Joan Rivers\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler attend the 2009 Vanity Fair Oscar party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset Tower Hotel on February 22, 2009 in West Hollywood, CA.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/gerard-butler-jokes-about-marrying-jennifer-aniston-2009227/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Gerard Butler Jokes About Marrying Jennifer Aniston"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

I was always disconnected from myself; there was this idea of perfection I couldn&apos;t ever get to. But all women struggle with insecurity, and we all have something we don&apos;t like about ourselves.&quot;  \r\n\r\nSimpson - who underwent criticism this year after looking fuller-figured at a Florida concert - says she is psyched at the idea of hosting her own VH1 reality show, The Price of Beauty. The show tracks her journey around the world in search of what people find beautiful and why.\r\n&quot;No matter how much money you spend to make yourself beautiful--with all the products, the diets, the plastic surgery--in the end, women need to fall in love with themselves and realize they&apos;re beautifully and wonderfully made. There is no &apos;perfect&apos; you,&quot; says Simpson, who has admitted to getting Restylane to make her lips plumper.\r\n&quot;It will be interesting for women to see how self-obsessed we&apos;ve become,&quot; she says.\r\n\r\nShe credits ex Tony Romo with helping her become more comfortable in her own skin.   &quot;Tony never ever places judgment,&quot; she says. &quot;You can just relax and feel beautiful. He&apos;s just that type of person.&quot;  \r\n\r\nAlthough she did the interview before her split with Romo, she says, &quot;If this article comes out and we&apos;re not together, I&apos;d still love [Tony], and he&apos;d still be a huge part of who I am today.&quot;  \r\n\r\nSimpson also addresses her 2006 divorce from Nick Lachey.  &quot;It was hard to imagine I would ever walk down the aisle again,&quot; she says. &quot;It was like a death in the family: You go through the mourning stage, then the rebellion, and then all of a sudden you have to find life by yourself. Once you do that, you feel complete --and that&apos;s the only time you can truly fall in love again, and give yourself over completely to another person.&quot;\r\n\r\nAlthough her first marriage failed, says she will &quot;definitely&quot; wed again.\r\n&quot;I loved everything about marriage,&quot; she tells Glamour. &quot;I loved having a companion to wake up with and have barbecues with. But things happen and people grow apart. I don&apos;t really ever talk about the divorce because it was a heart-wrenching thing to go through.

Conrad&apos;s on-and-off beau Jenner who began dating a girl two days after Conrad left for Paris, according to a new Hills clip, told Us he thought her show was amazing. &quot;Everything&apos;s going good,&quot; he replied when asked how his relationship with Conrad was.  Of course, Conrad&apos;s show wouldn&apos;t be complete without her BFFs (and new roommates) Bosworth and Patridge. (Former Teen Vogue colleague Whitney Port and actress Lisa Rinna, as well as Conrade&apos;s family, were also on hand.)\r\n&quot;I&apos;m so excited for Lauren today!&quot; Bosworth, who wore pieces from Conrad&apos;s collection to the show, told Us. &quot;It&apos;s such a culmination of everything she&apos;s been working so hard on for the past few years.&quot; Life in their new home is &quot;really good,&quot; Bosworth added. &quot;We have a brand new puppy, it&apos;s been great.

As the Los Angeles Times reports that TLC is scrambling to find a way to revise the May 25 season premiere given the latest news on the couple, the delicate balancing act of how to incorporate reality into a heavily produced &quot;reality&quot; show is in the balance.  For the Gosselin clan, it&apos;s not just their show -- but their lifestyle -- that hang in the balance.   \nSee Jon and Kate through the years.\nKate, who grew up in a trailer park and didn&apos;t go on her first airplane ride until her honeymoon to Disney World, now flies only first class for speaking engagements (mostly paid for by churches), sells signed photos of her kids for $20 a pop at appearances, and received a free tummy tuck after giving birth (Jon received a free hair transplant). A family source says while pregnant with the sextuplets, she grew &quot;obsessed&quot; with how many goodies the famed McCaughey septuplets received in 1997.\nCheck out celebs caught cheating. \nJon, now a stay-at-home dad, was fired from his job at Style Craft Corp in 2004 after &quot;spending much more time&quot; on a &quot;quest&quot; for freebies than working, the company&apos;s owner, David Rothermel, tells Us. (Rothermel finally has spoken out after growing furious at the couple&apos;s well-worn claim that he was fired because the company didn&apos;t want to insure his family.)  \nSee photos of Jon Gosselin and his mistress\n&quot;Instead of keeping the attention on their kids, they&apos;ve let the attention turn to money and fame,&quot; says a family source of Jon and Kate, who, according to Nielson Media Research, are ranked No. 8 on the list of cable shows with the most product placement.  Marc Berman, senior television editor at Mediaweek, says producers cannot continue to portray the Gosselins as an everyday family trying to raise eight kids.  &quot;Their lives have changed - they&apos;re not struggling anymore,&quot; Berman tells Usmagazine.com. &quot;They&apos;re eating at fancy restaurants now. Yeah, they still have eight children, but things are different.  Below, a sample of just some of the swag they&apos;ve scored:  - Free beds - Front-loader washing machines - New furniture - Free solar panels for &quot;Going Green&quot; episode - Clothes from Gymboree and Gap - Mady &amp; Cara birthday at American Girl Place (2 dolls and birthday package for 2 adults &amp; 2 kids): $710 - Trip to Florida Key&apos;s for Jon&apos;s 30th birthday -Tickets to Dutch Wonderland amusement park: $309.50 -1/2 an organic cow from Natural Acres Farm: $1,395.00 -Tickets to Philadelphia Zoo: $104.00 -Tickets to Walt Disney World: $654.00 per day - Utah house rental (estimate: $5,000), ski lift tickets $72 for six days), ski school lessons ($140 per child) - Upright piano, which they got rid of when they moved into their new $1.1 million home : $5,550-$6,350 - Violin: $100-$300 - Old house re-carperted -Crayola Factory Tour: $90.00 -Teeth Whitening (for Jon &amp; Kate): $1,310 (average price for 2 adults) -Hair plugs (Jon): $5,200 (average cost) -Sesame Street Place tickets: $509.50 -Day with Thomas the Tank Engine: $180.00 -Beach trip to North Carolina, house rental, Jeep tour -Sight &amp; Sound Christian theatre tickets: $236.00 -SkyBox at Phillies game -LegoLand tickets: $550.00 -San Diego Zoo tickets: $278.00 -Grand Wailea Resort (Hawaii) for 2008 vow renewal: Suites range from $725-$1,080 per night. -2 purebred German Shepherd puppies: $1,000-$3,000 per dog - Please Touch Museum tickets: $150.00 - Giants grocery store: $5,000 in gift cards and a year&apos;s supply of diapers  In order for the show to survive, Mediaweek&apos;s Berman says the Gosselins need to be upfront with the audience.  &quot;They&apos;re now a celebrity couple,&quot; says Berman. &quot;The emphasis of the show has changed, and they need to address how they&apos;ve evolved.&quot;  &quot;If they don&apos;t evolve the show, I think the audience is going to be upset,&quot; he tells Us. &quot;You can&apos;t fool an audience.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jon and Kate: How Much Money Is at Stake", "datePublished": "2009-05-13T20:12:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:53+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 704, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#respond"]}], "description": "As TLC struggles with the season premiere, a look at the Gosselin millions and freebies"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/", "name": "Jon and Kate: How Much Money Is at Stake", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-13T20:12:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:53+00:00", "description": "As TLC struggles with the season premiere, a look at the Gosselin millions and freebies", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Jon kate goodies b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-and-kate-how-much-money-is-at-stake-2009135/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Jon and Kate: How Much Money Is at Stake"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Playwright David Mamet slammed Piven for &quot;leaving show business to pursue a career as a thermometer,&quot; but, in his new statement below, the Entourage star points out mercury poisoning was &quot;recently described by the Obama administration...as the world&apos;s gravest chemical problem.&quot;\nSee photos of big celeb scandals.\n Piven is slated to go before an arbitrator on June 8 and 9.  His statement, released to BroadwayWorld.com Wednesday, reads:  &quot;After Mr. Piven was diagnosed with a potentially toxic Mercury level, he reluctantly left SPEED-THE-PLOW at the insistence of his doctors, who warned him that enforced rest was required to avoid severe medical problems, including a heart attack. Mr. Piven is looking forward to testifying in Arbitration along with his doctors so that the truth comes out about the very health serious risks caused by Mercury exposure, which the Obama administration has recently described as the world&apos;s gravest chemical problem.\nCheck out the day&apos;s top news photos.\nStarting back in December, Mr. Piven repeatedly offered to turn over his medical records to the Producers subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The Producers repeatedly rejected that proposal. It is obvious that the Producers did not really want the medical records Mr. Piven volunteered to provide, since those records would confirm the medical necessity of his withdrawal from the show. The Producers&apos; recent statement claiming that they had offered to keep the medical records private is nothing more than PR &quot;spin.&quot; We have confirmed with Actors Equity today that the Union is not aware of any such confidentiality proposal by the Producers.  In addition to repeatedly offering his medical records subject to a confidentiality agreement to prevent the Producers from disseminating them to the media, Mr. Piven had also repeatedly offered to be examined by a doctor designated by the Producers both before, during and after his hospitalization for toxic Mercury levels. The Producers never took him up on that offer.  The fact that the Producers issued a statement announcing the Arbitration dates suggests that this is part of a punitive strategy to intimidate actors so that they ignore serious health symptoms and the advice of medical professionals due to fear that they will be sued.&quot;\nFollow Us Weekly on Twitter!", "isPartOf": {"@id":

I have tried to live my life in a way that would make those around me proud of me, and until recently, I think I was doing a pretty good job. I wish I had the chance to live those few moments again, but unfortunately I can&apos;t.&quot;  &quot;I cannot go into what happened, and most importantly, I&apos;m not going to sit here and make any excuses. I take great pride in me being able to exercise self-control and what I did was inexcusable. I am very sad and very ashamed of what I&apos;ve done.\r\nSee Chris Brown and Rihanna through the years\r\n&quot;My mother and my spiritual teachers have taught me way better than that. I have told Rihanna countless times, and I&apos;m telling you today that I am truly, truly sorry, and I wasn&apos;t able to handle the situation both differently and better. I recognize that I&apos;ve truly been blessed. I&apos;ve been blessed with a wonderful family, wonderful friends and fans. God has been generous in giving me the ability which has brought me fame and fortune.  &quot;I have done a lot of soul-searching, and over the past several months I&apos;ve talked with my minister and my mother, and I spent a lot of time trying to understand what happened and why. I have let a lot of people down, and I realize that.\r\nSee stars who have survived abuse\r\n&quot;No one is more disappointed than in me than I am. As many of you know, I grew up in a home where there was domestic violence and I saw firsthand what uncontrolled rage could do. I have sought and am continuing to seek help to ensure that what occurred in February can never happen again.  &quot;As I sit here today I can tell you that I will do everything in my power to make sure that it never happens again, and I promise that. What I did was unacceptable, 100 percent. I can only ask and pray that you forgive me, please. I hope that others learn from my mistakes. I intend to live my life so that I am truly worthy of the term &apos;role model.&apos; Thank you,&quot; Brown concludes.\r\nSee Rihanna through the years\r\nLast month, the 20-year-old singer pleaded guilty to felony assault by means likely to cause great bodily injury. In exchange, he was sentenced to five years probation and 180 days of community labor to be served in Virginia.

Jennifer Aniston came in at No. 8, earning $25 million -- and beating  ex Brad Pitt, who ranked No. 9 (but took home $28 million).\r\nRevisit Brad and Jen&apos;s most romantic moments.\r\nBarack Obama became the first active president to appear in the list, coming in at No. 49.

Barack and Michelle Obama made their first trip to New York City since he took office, enjoying dinner and a Broadway play over the weekend.  After both parents attended eldest daughter Malia&apos;s soccer match (her team won), they boarded a C-20 plane and arrived in the Big Apple Saturday afternoon. (A White House press spokesperson said that the President had &quot;promised&quot; his wife that he would take her to a Broadway show after the election was all finished.)\nSee photos of Barack Obama&apos;s first 100 days in Washington\nTheir first stop? New York&apos;s West Village neighborhood, where they dined at Bluehill Restaurant.  Fellow diner Eva Fleischer of Manhattan said she &quot;had no idea&quot; the Obamas would be there when she made her 5:30 p.m. reservations.  &quot;They had to pat us down,&quot; she told reporters outside the restaurant, which is known for its  &quot;locally grown fare.&quot;  As the Obamas left, Fleischer recalled, the President said to her table, &quot;&apos;Hi, guys!&apos; It was very exciting because we didn&apos;t expect to see him here. It was really neat.&quot;\nSee the Obama family photo album\n Another diner, Susan Korchak of Manhattan, noted that Michelle &quot;is very tall. She&apos;s just statuesque and gorgeous.&quot;  Fan went wild as the two exited the restaurant. Blockades were set up to keep the crowds of people at bay on the streets. Several people weren&apos;t allowed to cross the street to get back to their apartment, but they were happy to wait it out.

He just didn&apos;t want to live after that. You know, he had done everything ... he could possibly do for his daughter and she wanted no part of him once he couldn&apos;t do anything for her.&quot;\nSee then-and-now photos of your favorite 90210 stars\n Of her remarks, Candy said on The HuffingtonPost.com, &quot;I didn&apos;t intend to create headlines. I was asked a question about my daughter not speaking with my family, and I answered truthfully.&quot;  &quot;My husband was very ill, and he had stopped eating and taking liquids. He called Tori on a daily basis, and never stopped asking if Tori had returned his call. We had to say no every day,&quot; she went on.\nSee Tori Spelling and other moms in bikinis\nOf making such an outlandish remark, Candy now says, &quot;I should have known better, but it is the truth.&quot;  Tori and Candy have been estranged for some time. Tori has never revealed the reason they don&apos;t talk. Instead, she has vaguely said they just &quot;don&apos;t go together.&quot;\nTake a peek at Tori and Dean&apos;s family photo album \n In April, Candy -- who released her frank memoir Stories From Candyland a few weeks before Tori debuted her book, Mommyhood -- posted a public letter to Tori on her website, pushing for a reconciliation. &quot;I want to see you and your family&#x201C; in private, like the &apos;normal family&apos; you say always wanted,&quot; pleaded Candy, who said she has met Tori&apos;s son Liam, 2, but never met daughter Stella, 11 months.  The HuffingtonPost.com Tori told Usmagazine.com in April: &quot;If I said one thing to my mother, it wouldn&apos;t be public because if she does intend to have a relationship with her grandchildren -- which I am totally open to -- I just would like her to approach us privately.&quot;\nSee Tori Spelling and other stars at fashion week!", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/candy-spelling-stands-by-tori-killed-father-remark-2009295/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Aaron Spelling", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/aaron-spelling/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Candy Spelling", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/candy-spelling/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tori Spelling", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/tori-spelling/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/candy-spelling-stands-by-tori-killed-father-remark-2009295/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/candy-spelling-stands-by-tori-killed-father-remark-2009295/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Candy Spelling Stands By Tori &#8220;Killed&#8221;

At one point in the routine, Holmes -- who also pranced around in a black velvet fedora, nylon stockings and body-hugging skirt -- was lifted over three dancers&apos; heads.\nFor her finish, she tossed her hat in the air, and one of the other male dancers -- which included SYTYCD alums Mark Kanemura and Joshua Allen -- caught it.  \nCheck out photos of stars dancing!\nGarland&apos;s son, Joey Luft, was in attendance at Thursday&apos;s taping and saw Holmes&apos; tribute to his late mom.   &quot;I bet Judy Garland&apos;s giving [Katie] a standing ovation in heaven,&quot; Murphy said.\nHolmes signed on to perform for the show&apos;s 100th episode after judge/executive producer Nigel Lythgoe approached her to join the board of directors for his Dizzy Feet Foundation, which offers scholarships to underprivileged youth.\n&quot;She put herself out there and she didn&apos;t have to do that, so I&apos;m very delighted in her performance,&quot; Lythgoe told Us of the actress, who donated her full performance fee to Dizzy Feet Foundation.\n&quot;I think it is important to experience music and dancing and singing and the arts and sports,&quot; Holmes said on the show. &quot;This is the next generation. I think it is important to give them every opportunity to grow and discover what it is that they like and to have access to the best. &quot;  \nLook back at Katie Holmes&apos; most memorable roles\nAfter her TV performance, Lythgoe says Holmes has been bitten by the dancing bug.  &quot;Katie&apos;s really taken to dancing,&quot; the judge said. &quot;She is filming a movie in Australia and called me and said, &apos;I have found some great classes to take in Melbourne while I&apos;m here.&apos; She got really hooked on it!&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/judge-katie-holmes-put-herself-out-there-for-sytycd-performance-2009247/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Katie Holmes", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/katie-holmes/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mary Murphy", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/mary-murphy/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigel Lythgoe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/nigel-lythgoe/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/judge-katie-holmes-put-herself-out-there-for-sytycd-performance-2009247/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/judge-katie-holmes-put-herself-out-there-for-sytycd-performance-2009247/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Judge: Katie Holmes &#8220;Put Herself Out There&#8221;

But Jolie (who donated $1 million to Pakistani refugees yesterday through her and Pitt&apos;s foundation) makes sure her kids understand they&apos;re fortunate.  \nDo you know who the most generous celebs are?\n&quot;Some of my kids are from countries that have seen conflict.

Hopefully I&apos;ll take them to as many countries as I can and raise them with an education of the world.&quot;  \nCheck out all the places where Angie has traveled\nJolie says that despite her position as a UNCHR Goodwill Ambassador, she&apos;s &quot;not a political person.\n&quot;But I think it doesn&apos;t take much to understand that this is the front line of us fighting against extremists, where all that we hold dear and all that we value is really on the line,&quot; she explained.\n&quot;This fight is a very personal fight for all of us. And these victims of this crisis, these regular people who are mostly agriculturalists that are fleeing are, you know, we should feel a real connection to them, identify with them.... So I think at least what we can be doing is assisting the humanitarian crisis and assisting the people and the desperate families and the children.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id":

Lakers teammates, Ryan Seacrest, Kelly Osbourne, reality star Brittny Gastineau and TV personality LaLa Vasquez.\r\n&quot;I wish them the best, and I&apos;m sure they are going to have a great, happy, long marriage,&quot; Vasquez told Us at an event last Thursday.\r\n\r\nKardashian and Odom made their first public appearance Sept. 3 at West Hollywood club Guys and Dolls.&quot;Khloe is smart and beautiful, and that is very hard to find,&quot; Odom -- who recently signed a four-year, $33 million contract with the Lakers -- told Us at the time.Why the rush to the altar?\r\n\r\nOdom&apos;s basketball schedule was one issue. (The Lakers are set to play their first preseason game on Oct. 7.)&quot;Khloe and Lamar [wanted] to get married before Lamar has to go away for training, and the [basketball] season starts up [this fall],&quot; a source tells the new issue of Us Weekly.\r\n\r\nDespite the quickie nuptials, the pair will last, their friends tell Us.\r\n&quot;They are just a great couple,&quot; wedding guest Gastineau told Us last week. &quot;I think when you meet a couple, you can just tell if they work. And they work.&quot;\r\nAdded Lakers player Ron Artest, &quot;Love is strong, so I think it&apos;s cool.

So how did Spears transform herself so quickly?  Well, for starters, no more Malibu rum and cokes with fast-food chasers. These days, Spears, 25, is sticking to a more body-friendly regimen.  After five hours haggling with lawyers over her divorce in L.A. March 29, the singer hit local eatery, The Bridge, and drank sweet iced tea and mineral water.  Then, two nights later in Vegas, Spears dined on sushi and vegetable dumplings (and more iced tea) with pals at Tao restaurant.   Indeed a change of pace may have been just what the doctor ordered.  &quot;After about three weeks to a month of not drinking alcohol and getting enough water and nutrients into your body, you&apos;ll easily look like a different person,&quot; NYC-based dermatologist Jeannette Graf tells Us, adding that Spears&apos; healthy new habits help increase circulation to the skin, accounting for that healthier glow.  Spears &quot;is repairing her skin, so no more puffy face,&quot; says Graf.  Her recent workouts have also gotten her blood pumping. Two days after leaving rehab, Spears attended a hip-hop class at Millennium Dance Complex in L.A. &quot;When I saw her, she looked beautiful,&quot; instructor Darrien Henning tells Us.  Do Britney&apos;s friends and family think she&apos;s cured? What&apos;s Brit&apos;s next career move? How is Kevin handling the divorce?

He said Jenkins -- who is considered &quot;armed and dangerous&quot; -- may have escaped to his native Canada on foot after the nude body of his ex-wife, Jasmine Fiore, 28, was found stuffed into a suitcase in a Buena Park, Calif., trash bin over the weekend. It was also revealed that her teeth and fingers had been removed.  &quot;Ryan Jenkins is an animal,&quot; said Robert Hasman, a former boyfriend of Fiore&apos;s, who attended the conference with other relatives. &quot;What he has done to Jasmine is unspeakable.&quot;   \nLook back at Hollywood&apos;s ugliest splits.\nA warrant has been issued for his arrest, and $10 million bail has been set. It is still unclear if Jenkins -- who was named a &quot;person of interest&quot; earlier -- is charged with first-degree or second-degree murder, spokesperson Farrah Emami told Us Thursday.  A U.S. Marshall said his agency is cooperating with Canadian law enforcement to find Jenkins.  They are still investigating for motive.   In June, Jenkins was charged with a misdemeanor count of &quot;battery constituting domestic violence&quot; for hitting Fiore in the arm. He&apos;s due in court in December.  \nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\nJenkins -- who earned the nickname &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; on Megan Wants a Millionaire -- has a criminal history in his Calgary hometown, according to the Associated Press.

At the time, Twain said: &quot;I need some time to heal this broken heart, but make no mistake: I will be back and hopefully stronger than ever.&quot;  \nLook back at Hollywood&apos;s ugliest divorces.\nThe country singer went on to dazzle at the Country Music Awards last November -- and debut her relationship with Thiebaud&apos;s ex husband, Patrick.\nIn her new letter to fans, Twain says she doesn&apos;t need to rehash the pain of her breakup.  &quot;The personal issues that took place just over a year ago have been well documented, and there&apos;s no need to go into more detail here,&quot; she writes. &quot;Since then, I&apos;ve been inspired by my pain to write and use writing as a therapy through the suffering. I truly wouldn&apos;t wish this on anybody as a means to get inspired, but it&apos;s been a productive period with so much emotion trying to find it&apos;s way out.&quot;\nShe&apos;s focused on songwriting and raising her 7-year-old son with Lange, Eja D&apos;Angelo, in Switzerland.\nSee the worst dressed country stars of all time.\n&quot;As many things as there have been to write about through this difficult time in my life, healing is serious business and has taken a lot of the wind out of my sails, slowing me down at times,&quot; she writes. &quot;As you know, I am a mom and all my energy goes to making sure my little man is healthy and happy in every way. This is a full time job, as any parent understands, but especially difficult when you are battling your own personal crisis at the same time while trying to spare your child of being affected by your own suffering.&quot;\n&quot;During this intense period, I was managing to hide my devastation from Eja and cried only when I was alone,&quot; she confesses.   &quot;One time when I was having a weak moment listening to some sad music and sobbing and slobbering over my computer&apos;s keyboard, Eja walked up behind me and asked me why I was crying,&quot; she goes on. &quot;He wasn&apos;t sad at first -- just totally surprised to see his mom crying (he is seven and never saw me cry before), and didn&apos;t know what to make of it.&quot;\n&quot;I was quick on my feet to answer him though and told Eja that music was very powerful and can make people quite emotional,&quot; Twain continues. &quot;It can make you want to dance, feel angry, happy or sad and that this song was sad and made me cry. He accepted this, hugged me and went back to what he was doing. Phew, that was tough!&quot;\nLife has returned to normal.  &quot;Each morning I put my son on the school bus, feed our two dogs Sony and Dolly, drink my orange juice and sit down at the computer to write,&quot; she says.\nHer songs &quot;often comes out in the form of poetry, diary notes or e-mails to friends,&quot; she says. &quot;I often go back to my e-mails for song ideas. When I write in letter form, I don&apos;t hold back.&quot;\nBut she&apos;s also taken a few chances.  &quot;I&apos;ve jumped out of an airplane at 10,000 feet, I&apos;m riding Spanish and Arabian horses, traveling to exotic places, I&apos;ve been deep sea diving for the first time!&quot; she writes. &quot;I pull the odd all-nighter, read more books, listen to Eja&apos;s favourite music with him, LOUD (ironically his favourite band is ACDC) and basically I&apos;m enjoying life.&quot;\nTwain is grateful to her fans.  &quot;The many blogs and e-mails have warmed my heart, strengthened my confidence, given me courage, and have often even made me laugh out loud&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#xA6;in a good way! I know I am not alone and realize through your support that you are all [rooting] for Eja and I, and our well-being.&quot;\n&quot;Time has a way of making everything right, and it is my hope that good music will eventually come out of it,&quot; she says, explaining the delay in putting out her next album. &quot;I say &apos;good music&apos; since I don&apos;t want to just throw anything at you, just for the sake of hurrying up to get it out.&quot;\nTwain signs off: &quot;Till next time, my friends. Be well, and peace and happiness to all of you.

RUN DON&apos;T WALK!!!! SELLING OUT!!!!!  Lately, I have become upset with overpriced luxury merchandise that&apos;s nothing but neoprene, plastic or patent leather. At $750-$2000 I want my shoes to be exotic, something that&apos;s highly luxe and unique because I am an exotirican!   Enter Nine West with the Joely Boutique 9 sandal.\r\nThis is FIERCE and on fire. Almost gone, in fact.   Recently, I was on a shoot and had a slew of shoes for Mandisa, the former Idol contestant who we were styling and who recently dropped 100 pounds and looks so lovely. She tried on several pairs of heels we had for her but everything was way too small (she&apos;s an 11) and not at all comfortable to her at all. The last thing you want is an unhappy celebrity/model on a shoot. When she saw we had Nine West shoes, she was ecstatic because she knew she could endure standing in one spot for 45 minutes in a 3-inch heel.\r\nThese are sooooo sexy and its ivory multi toned reptile for $149.99. It&apos;s a stunningly sexy strappy leather sandal with cut out details, knotted accents, leather sole and buckle closure. 4&quot; leather covered heel. I love snake on the foot because it&apos;s like a neutral and makes you appear longer because it blends in with most skin tones and gives you an added oomph! A shuzzzzzzzz.

But what I don&apos;t have to talk about is what happened between Heath and me in our relationship.&quot;She and Ledger -- who met while filming Brokeback Mountain -- dated for three years before they amicably split in August 2007. The duo had a daughter, Matilda Rose, 3.\r\n\r\n&quot;Brokeback Mountain was an unrepeatable moment in time, a very charmed time in my life,&quot; she tells Vogue. &quot;I was in love. I was in a movie I was proud to be a part of, and with a beautiful brand-new baby. Everything was good in that moment.&#x201D;When he died, she struggled to cope.\r\n\r\n&quot;I was holding it together by a string and a paper clip in the fall and winter,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t know if I could keep it all together&#x2026; You console yourself by saying it&#x2019;s all a deepening process. But it&#x2019;s wired. After the first year, the pain is less intense -- it&#x2019;s less immediate. But the magical thinking goes away too. And that&#x2019;s a whole new reckoning.&quot;Still, their child provided her strength. &quot;Every time I really miss him and wonder where he&#x2019;s gone, I just look at her,&quot; she says. \r\n\r\nIn July 2008, she began dating director Spike Jonze but admits it hasn&apos;t been easy.&quot;I thought falling in love again was the only thing that was going to save me from the pain,&quot; she laments. &quot;This erroneous idea: It just makes things more complicated.&#x201D;&#xA0;Of the future, she says: &quot;I feel hopeful and grateful. For a while I thought we had lost everything. It makes you want to love better and live better.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 390}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Heath Ledger", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/heath-ledger/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michelle Williams", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michelle-williams/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Michelle Williams: Matilda Reminds Me of Heath Everyday", "datePublished": "2009-09-15T20:51:19+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T02:00:04+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 503, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity Moms"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#respond"]}], "description": "\"Every time I really miss him and wonder where he\u2019s gone, I just look at her,\u201d she says."}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/", "name": "Michelle Williams: Matilda Reminds Me of Heath Everyday", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-09-15T20:51:19+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T02:00:04+00:00", "description": "\"Every time I really miss him and wonder where he\u2019s gone, I just look at her,\u201d she says.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 390, "caption": "1253045972_michelle 290"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michelle-williams-matilda-reminds-me-of-heath-ledger-everyday-2009159/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Michelle Williams: Matilda Reminds Me of Heath Everyday"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

She was 62.\nThe actress passed away Thursday at 9:28 a.m. PST at Saint John&apos;s Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif., after a two-and-a-half year battle with cancer. She was with longtime partner Ryan O&apos;Neal, friend Alana Stewart and her doctor Lawrence Piro.   \nTake a look back at the life of Farrah Fawcett\n&quot;After a long and brave battle with cancer, our beloved Farrah has passed away,&quot; O&apos;Neal said in a statement to Usmagazine.com. &quot;Although this is an extremely difficult time for her family and friends, we take comfort in the beautiful times that we  shared with Farrah over the years and the knowledge that her life brought joy to so many people around the world.&quot;\nA forlorn O&apos;Neal, wearing a Lance Armstrong Live Strong bracelet, was spotted leaving the hospital Thursday, telling photographers, &quot;She&apos;s gone.&quot;\nRemember those stars who died last year \nCAREER HIGHS\nBorn Feb. 2, 1947 in Corpus Christi, Texas, Fawcett, a former college beauty queen, was discovered by a talent scout shortly after moving to Hollywood in the 1960s. She went on to appear in countless commercials and had guest roles on a variety of television shows.\nBut her career took off in the 1970s -- shortly after she wed actor Lee Majors (they divorced in 1982) -- when she appeared in now-iconic posters wearing a red one-piece bathing suit.\nSee more of today&apos;s top celeb news photos\nIn 1976, she landed a role as sporty undercover detective Jill Munroe on Charlie&apos;s Angels.  She left Angels after only one year and began taking on more serious roles.\nShe received an Emmy nod for her portrayal of a battered wife in the 1984 TV movie The Burning Bed and received two more Emmy nominations for her roles as a predator in the miniseries Small Sacrifices and in 2004&apos;s The Guardian.\nThroughout her career, the actress -- who caused a stir when she posed for Playboy in 1995 and, again, in 1997 at the age of 50 -- always downplayed her looks.\n&quot;God gave women intuition and femininity,&quot; Fawcett once said. &quot;Used properly, the combination easily jumbles the brain of any man I&apos;ve ever met.&quot;  \nA BRAVE BATTLE\nIn 2006, Fawcett revealed she had anal cancer. Although she appeared to be cancer-free a year later, the disease returned, spreading to her liver, despite seeking alternative medical treatments in Germany.\n&quot;Cancer is a disease that is mysterious, headstrong and makes its own rules. And mine, to this date, is incurable,&quot; Fawcett said on the NBC documentary Farrah&apos;s Story that aired this past spring.\n&quot;I know that everyone will die eventually, but I do not want to die of this disease. I want to stay alive,&quot; she went on. &quot;So I say to God, because it is, after all, in his hands. It is seriously time for a miracle.&quot;  \nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon \nLOVE STORY\nFawcett and O&apos;Neal began dating in 1980 and have lived together for years. They have a son, Redmond, 24, who is currently serving a prison term in California after repeated drug offenses.\nDespite proposing to her countless times, she always told him no.  But earlier this week, O&apos;Neal told Barbara Walters: &quot;I&apos;ve asked her to marry me, again, and she&apos;s agreed.   He said they &quot;will&quot; wed &quot;as soon as she can, say yes.&quot;\nIn May, O&apos;Neal told NBC News that he has fallen more in love with Fawcett as he watched her bravely battle cancer.\n&quot;I know this, that in the last two years I loved her more than I&apos;ve ever loved her - ever,&quot; he told Meredith Vieira. &quot;She&apos;s so much more of a woman ... powerful, courageous, fearless and all those adjectives.

Sources say that around 3 in the morning, Octomom&apos;s house got vandalized by some uninvited April Fools pranksters.     In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, a spokesman for the La Habra Police Department verified that police units were dispatched to the Suleman home on Madonna Lane shortly after 7 A.M. Wednesday.\r\n&quot;A nanny heard a loud noise around 3 A.M.  She looked outside and saw a large white cargo van speeding away. The nannies did not call the police or go outside at that time,&quot; according to Lt. Tom Dutton of L.H.P.D.&apos;s Media Relations office. &quot;When the morning nannies arrived for work at 6:30 A.M. they saw the rear window of [the] Suleman van had been smashed and a car seat appeared to have been thrown through the window,&quot; Dutton said.\r\nThe car seat apparently was from another one of the Suleman&apos;s vehicles and had been positioned outside on the porch next to the front door. The police report listed the damage to the van as a shattered window, a broken rear window wiper arm and a dent to the rear cargo door.    No suspects were reported and no other witnesses could be located.\r\nSee photos of all eight octuplets!\r\n&quot;Every day that passes is a milestone in the lives and care of the octuplets,&quot; Dr. Mandhir Gupta says. &quot;Being able to send another baby home is a significant step in their development.&quot; Jonah -- the last octuplet at the hospital -- &quot;continues to progress well and remains at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center.

His ongoing custody battle with ex Denise Richards over their daughters, Sam, 3, and Lola, 2.    In recently leaked court papers filed by Richards, 36, she claimed that Sheen&apos;s engagement to Mueller, 29, a real-estate investor, was a media stunt. She also claimed Sheen sent her emails calling her &quot;a sad jobless pig&quot; and telling her to &quot;go cry to your bald mom&quot; (her mother is undergoing chemotherapy treatments), among other nasty allegations.  For his part, Sheen has denied those claims and has also asked a judge for the ability to choose his own child care providers for daughters when they are with him and Mueller.  &quot;It&apos;s just so unfortunate because what&apos;s been lost in the entire, this ridiculous and unnecessary circus, is that the initial request was just to be able to hire my own nanny,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s all I asked for and an extra weekend ... cut to two months later, this is what I&apos;m forced to deal with.&quot; Still, Sheen is keeping a sense of humor about the whole ordeal.

Polanski&apos;s arrest has said to have been sought globally for the past four years.\r\n&quot;There was a valid arrest request and we knew when he was coming,&quot; ministry spokesman Guido Balmer told The Associated Press. &quot;That&apos;s why he was taken into custody.&quot; Balmer also added that the U.S. needs to make a formal extradition request.\r\nSee the day&apos;s top celeb news photos.\r\nIn the statement released by Swiss authorities, Polanski is said to be in &quot;provisional detention for extradition,&quot; but will not be transferred to U.S. authorities until all proceedings are completed. He has the right to contest his detention and any extradition decision in Swiss courts.The filmmaker, who helmed such projects as Rosemary&apos;s Baby and 2002&apos;s The Pianist, fled the U.S. in the 70s after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old. Polanski, who has lived for the last 30 years in France, left the country before his sentencing, and has since asked a judge to dismiss the case against him.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, a California judge demanded Polanski return to the U.S. in order to formally apply for the case&apos;s dismissal, but when he refused to appear in person for fear of being arrested as a fugitive, Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza denied his request.Polanski, who received a directing Oscar for The Pianist, is married to French actress Emanuelle Seigner, and has two children.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 342}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Roman Polanski", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/roman-polanski/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Roman Polanski Arrested in Sex Case", "datePublished": "2009-09-27T17:00:44+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-10-15T21:08:04+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 349, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#respond"]}], "description": "The Oscar-winning Director faces extradition to U.S. after eluding justice for 30 years"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/", "name": "Roman Polanski Arrested in Sex Case", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-09-27T17:00:44+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-10-15T21:08:04+00:00", "description": "The Oscar-winning Director faces extradition to U.S. after eluding justice for 30 years", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 342, "caption": "1254069419_roman polanski b"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/director-roman-polanski-arrested-in-sex-case-2009279/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Roman Polanski Arrested in Sex Case"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

(At the memorial, she recalled how the two of them sneaked into Taylor&apos;s room for a peek at her dress.)  \r\n \r\nCorey Feldman -- who befriended Jackson in the 1980s -- also hadn&apos;t talked to the star in several years after having a falling out. Feldman ended up wearing a Jackson costume to the ceremony. &quot;I&apos;m just drained,&quot; he told Us.\r\nMany of Jackson&apos;s close friends were no-shows: Macaulay Culkin, ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley, Webster&apos;s Emmanuel Lewis, among others.  \r\nQuincy Jones, Jackson&apos;s longtime producer, and Diana Ross -- who was named in Jackson&apos;s will as a backup guardian to Jackson&apos;s three children -- also skipped the ceremony. Ross said she was at the memorial &quot;in spirit,&quot; but that she &quot;decided to pause and be silent&quot; because it &quot;feels right.&quot;\r\n\r\nArnold Klein, Jackson&apos;s longtime dermatologist and biological father to his two oldest children, was also noticeably absent. Debbie Rowe, mother of Jackson&apos;s two eldest children, said she skipped because she felt she&apos;d &quot;be an unnecessary distraction.&quot;\r\nAs for Elizabeth Taylor? She said she stayed home because she didn&apos;t want to &quot;be a part of the public whoopla.&quot;\r\nEven Jesse Jackson, who counseled the singer during his trial, was not present to speak. (A source tells Us Joe Jackson dislikes him and made sure Rev. Al Sharpton -- who laughed about Jackson during a 2008 discussion on race -- delivered a speech instead.)  \r\n\r\nInstead, most of the people who paid tribute to Jackson at Tuesday&apos;s memorial never met him at all.  \r\nQueen Latifah, who eulogized the singer, told David Letterman: &quot;I never actually got to meet him. My partner met him because we managed Naughty by Nature and they did a remix with him. He thought I had beautiful cheekbones.&quot;  \r\nJohn Mayer -- who performed an instrumental version of &quot;Human Nature&quot; -- told Larry King he also &quot;never met&quot; the King of Pop. His only connection was listening to Thriller as a teen. He said the Jackson family asked him to perform. (The Los Angeles Times&apos; Ann Powers remarked, &quot;I don&apos;t know why John Mayer is here. Was Slash not available?&quot;)\r\n\r\nJennifer Hudson -- who performed &quot;Will You Be There&quot; -- also had no prior relationship with Jackson. Mariah Carey covered the Jackson 5 classic &quot;I&apos;ll Be There,&quot; which she sang at the memorial. Though she worked with Jackson on his 2001 charity single &quot;What More Can I Give?&quot; she wasn&apos;t close with the singer, a source tells Us.  \r\nUsher, who sobbed and touched Jackson&apos;s coffin while singing &quot;Gone Too Soon,&quot; performed with Jackson at his 2001 celebration concert at New York City&apos;s Madison Square Garden. But &quot;their contact was minimal,&quot; the source tells Us, even though Usher has stated how influential Jackson was on his career.\r\nTwelve-year-old Britain&apos;s Got Talent finalist Shaheen Jafargholi&apos;s connection to Jackson? He toured as a young Jackson in the Thriller Live show and sang the Jackson 5 cover version of &quot;Who&apos;s Loving You&quot; on Britain&apos;s Got Talent.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-memorial-speakers-hardly-knew-him-200997/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Al Sharpton", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/al-sharpton/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brooke Shields", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/brooke-shields/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Letterman", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/david-letterman/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Diana Ross", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/diana-ross/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elizabeth Taylor", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/elizabeth-taylor/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jesse Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jesse-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Mayer", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/john-mayer/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lisa Marie Presley", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/lisa-marie-presley/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Macaulay Culkin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/macaulay-culkin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mariah Carey", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/mariah-carey/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Queen Latifah", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/queen-latifah/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Quincy Jones", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/quincy-jones/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Usher", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/usher/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-memorial-speakers-hardly-knew-him-200997/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-memorial-speakers-hardly-knew-him-200997/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Michael Jackson&#8217;s Memorial Speakers Hardly Knew Him", "datePublished": "2009-07-09T19:06:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:39+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-memorial-speakers-hardly-knew-him-200997/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 781, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-memorial-speakers-hardly-knew-him-200997/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-memorial-speakers-hardly-knew-him-200997/#respond"]}], "description": "Brooke Shields hadn't seen him in 18 years;

Designer Posen was equally smitten, telling Usmagazine.com: &quot;Gwyneth is a fashion legend, the ultimate movie star. Her gown was romantic, sophisticated and sexy. I&apos;ve always dreamed of working with her, she is our American Princess.&quot;&#xA0;\r\nAl Gore, star of the Best Documentary winner An Inconvenient Truth may have been less sultry, but he was no less popular; fans in the stands yelled down to the former veep, &quot;Run for president!&quot;&#xA0;\r\nSacha Baron Cohen, 35, heard some encouraging words of his own, which he apparently needed after losing the Best Adapted Screenplay award to The Departed. Entering the lobby of the Kodak Theater, Cohen conferred with Hollywood heavy Harvey Weinstein who told the de-mustached Borat &quot;Don&apos;t worry. You win some, you lose some. You&apos;ll have more chances.&quot;   Cohen then got even more homestyle comfort from his mom. Cohen&apos;s parents found their son in the lobby, hugged and kissed him and told him not to worry about not winning this one. Not only is she a super-sweet mom for saying that, but we hear she is the No. 4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan.\r\nAfter the show, Usmgazine.com ran into Sumner Redstone, CEO of Viacom, who bounced Tom Cruise on his cute little behind this summer. Redstone called an end to Paramount&apos;s long relationship with Cruise&apos;s production company and publicly called Cruise&apos;s couch-jumping behavior &apos;erratic.&apos;&#x9D;  But when we talked to Redstone after the Oscars, he promised to be all sunshine and moonbeams - or at least, not a jerk.  Sumner said he&apos;d &quot;love to see&quot; Cruise. Asked what he&apos;d say if he ran into his former cash cow, Sumner said he&apos;d tell Cruise, &quot;&apos;Hello, it is good to see you Tom. You are an old friend,&apos; which he is.&quot;  We would have loved to have seen what a bruised Cruise would have answered back.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Gwyneth Paltrow", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/gwyneth-paltrow/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sacha Baron Cohen", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/sacha-baron-cohen/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tom Cruise", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/tom-cruise/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Seen and Heard: Us Takes You Behind the Scenes at the Oscars", "datePublished": "2007-02-26T23:13:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:16+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 421, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#respond"]}], "description": "Behind the scenes at the Oscars!"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/", "name": "Seen and Heard: Us Takes You Behind the Scenes at the Oscars", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2007-02-26T23:13:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:16+00:00", "description": "Behind the scenes at the Oscars!", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Paltrow_BlogPhoto", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/seen-and-heard-us-takes-you-behind-the-scenes-at-the-oscars-2007262/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Seen and Heard: Us Takes You Behind the Scenes at the Oscars"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Every [news]paper, the headline was &apos;fat, fat, fat.&apos;&quot;\r\n\r\nHer body image issues weren&apos;t the only ones she was struggling with. Around that time in 2003, her half-sister, Yetunde Price, was shot and killed in L.A., outside the tennis courts where Williams and her sister Venus once played. The ordeal &quot;was really, really difficult&quot; for Williams. Williams channeled that pain into an upcoming memoir, On the Line.&quot;It talks about my journey through that whole situation, playing again when everyone said I couldn&apos;t do it,&quot; she said. &quot;They said I&apos;d never be No. 1, they said I&apos;d never win another grand slam.&quot;\r\n\r\nHer introspection helped, she told Banks, adding that she wrote herself &quot;little notes&quot; about &quot;the importance of staying positive.&quot;Williams admitted that she does not read her own press and has instead stored all those clippings away until she is retired from the game -- and ready to deal with them.&quot;You have to enjoy what you look like,&quot; she said. &quot;Sometimes I read things [that say] I&apos;m too fit or my arms are too muscular, but that&apos;s how I am. This is me, I love me. I think every person out there -- man, woman, regardless of age or gender -- needs to love themselves.&quot;\r\n\r\nThat love, she said, even extends to her competitors. Williams, who recently made headlines when she verbally assaulted a line judge during her U.S. Open match, asserts that she is most sorry about letting down those who have supported her. &quot;I play with a lot of fire, and I play with a lot of passion for everything I do,&quot; Williams said. &quot;I think the worst part was the fans missed out on seeing the end of an amazing match. We played over two hours of amazing tennis.&quot;To see Banks&apos; entire interview with Williams -- including a segment in which they play a game of tennis on the streets of NYC -- tune in to The Tyra Show on Thursday on the CW.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/exclusive-video-serena-williams-everyone-called-me-fat-2009239/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type":

They literally shut us out.&quot;  Tito says the family twice attempted an intervene earlier as well, but security staff kept the the family away.\r\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life in photos.\r\n&quot;In the first few intervention attempts, his staff and security would not let us on the property. They would block the road into Neverland with other vehicles so we couldn&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t drive in, all kinds of crazy things,&quot; says Tito, who admits he &quot;never saw&quot; Michael on drugs.  &quot;He deliberately did it away from us. He didn&apos;t want his family to know anything about that part of him,&quot; he says.

Wild partying soon followed.\r\n\r\n\"It was like Risky Business for 10 years,\" he says of the nineties. \"My parents were out of town, they left me a bunch of money, the car, and the house, and I didn't know when they were coming home. I'd worked so hard that by the time I was 20, I wanted to play hard. And I did that really well.\"\r\n\r\nSee then-and-now photos of your favorite TV stars\r\n\r\n\"I was never at a place where rehab would have been appropriate,\" he says of his drug use. \"Booze was what would make me want to stay out all night and do some blow or smoke a joint or whatever, so shutting that off was key. It's like ketchup and French fries \u2013 I don't want one without the other.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to wed actress Amanda Anka, whom he'd known since he was 18. But his partying didn't stop.\r\n\r\nSee your favorite child stars all grown up\r\n\r\nAfter coming home late one night, his wife finally gave him an ultimatum: Quit partying.\r\n\r\nBut he didn't entirely stop. Things got so bad that she even took a planned holiday in Mexico without him. It was then, alone on a rainy Christmas morning, that he decided to go to an AA meeting.\r\n\r\nSee unforgettable celeb scandals\r\n\r\nLooking back, Bateman tells Details, \"Do you want to continue being great at being in your twenties, or do you want to step up and graduate into adulthood?\"\r\n\r\nHe and his wife welcomed their first daughter, Francesca, in October 2006.\r\n\r\nJennifer Aniston \u2013 Bateman's costar in the upcoming comedy The Baster (out next spring) \u2013 met him 15 years ago on a group ski trip to Aspen. She said she is proud at how far he's come.\r\n\r\nSee photos of Jennifer Aniston smooching Jason Bateman \u2013 and more celeb PDA\r\n\r\n\"He should be here, he's meant to be here, and for whatever reason, it's taken until now,\" she says. \"There's no bull**** with him. Even though he was pretty wild in those days, something about those dimples and that sweet face made you go, 'Oh, it's okay that you just drove up the street backwards in a Range Rover with the door wide open.' I don't know what was happening there.

Now.&quot;)  Woulda Been Better: If Jack Black actually beat Peter O&apos;Toole over the head with his Nickelodeon Award.\r\nGreat Moment: Cute interplay with George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg.  Woulda Been Better If: They had made a Three Tenors joke.\r\nGreat Moment: Everything Ellen DeGeneres said (&quot;If it weren&apos;t for blacks, Jews and gays, there&apos;s be no Oscars.

Krieder also reiterates Jon&apos;s fears that his wife of nearly 10 years was having an affair with her married bodyguard, Steve Neild, as exclusively reported by Us. (Kate has confessed she and Jon might split in the same interview she says she is &quot;horrified&quot; by any allegations suggesting she and Neild are romantically involved; TLC refused comment.)\r\nCheck out photos of stars caught cheating.\r\n&quot;Jon came to our door one day and told [Krieder&apos;s wife] Jodi he suspects it&apos;s Steve the bodyguard, and he feels that he&apos;s getting the bad rap,&quot; Krieder says. &quot;He feels that Kate&apos;s not being faithful either.&quot;  A source tells the newest issue of Us Weekly that Kate and Neild (who flew to a promotional appearance in Michigan together last night from Maryland) have a &quot;very physical&quot; relationship.  At a recent public appearance, &quot;she was gently poking him, giving him little love pats, totally unlike the slapping she does with Jon. She and Steve were joking around so much, I actually wondered if they were having an affair,&quot; the source goes on.\r\nLook back at photo of Jon and Kate through the years.\r\nContinues Krieder: &quot;Although Jon has made some poor choices lately, he suspects that...Kate has been unfaithful. It&apos;s a horrible thing to talk about, but it just paints how bad and how different reality is from the reality show.&quot;  (The new issue of Us reveals even more public trysts between Jon and 23-year-old third grade teacher, Deanna Hummel, with whom he had a three-month affair.)\r\nSee photos of Jon and his mistress. \r\nFor much more on Kate and her bodyguard&apos;s &quot;inseparable&quot;

Meanwhile, Simpson has been working out again with a personal trainer in L.A. (she famously packed on pounds right before splitting from John Mayer and Nick Lachey), and going on movie dates with her mom and girlfriends.\n\n &quot;Everyone needs to know that hope floats...grab the strings and pull it back to you... Falling asleep with my mom and the dogs. Please, Lord, give all of my beautiful fans, friends, enemies, and family rest.

In an interview on 104.7 FM&apos;s Johnjay and Rich Show, the American Idol judge, 46, admits she fell for one of Sacha Baron Cohen&apos;s pranks in his upcoming film Bruno. (Cohen plays flamboyantly gay Austrian in the comedy, out July 10.)  Abdul says she received a call that she had won &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; in Germany.  When she arrived for a sit-down, &quot;I&apos;m greeted by this futuristic, Captain Nemo&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C;looking dude with a mohawk -- and he&apos;s flaming,&quot; recalls Abdul, who said she never signed a release (her publicist did).  &quot;I&apos;m like, &apos;OK, this is weird. Is this a variety show or something like that?&apos;&quot; she went on.\nSee Paula Abdul&apos;s wackiest outfits of all time\n&quot;So I walk in and there was no furniture except for a chair. And I&apos;m waiting and waiting,&quot; she continued. &quot;And this guy Bruno introduces himself, and I said, &apos;Hi.&apos; And he said, &apos;Here, have some food.&apos; And the food looked horrible! And I said, &apos;No, I&apos;m fine.&apos; And he said, &apos;It&apos;s very, very, very good.&apos; I said, &apos;That&apos;s Ok, I don&apos;t want to have it.&apos;&quot;  Abdul said Bruno then apologized for not having furniture for the interview.  &quot;He snaps his fingers and says, &apos;Gardeners!&apos;&quot; she recalled. &quot;And these two Mexican guys come in, and they drop down to all fours. I see him paying them like 10 bucks. They drop down to all fours and he says [to me], &apos;Sit down.&apos;&quot; And I said, &apos;I&apos;m not doing that!&apos;&quot;\nCheck out more celeb embarrassing moments\nAfter all, Abdul said, she was in a dress.  &quot;So I&apos;m tipping and holding my core muscles to not sit on them. And he pushes me down on them, and I&apos;m like, &apos;I&apos;m sorry!&apos;&quot; she said.    It got even more bizarre, Abdul said, when he kicked one of them and they all fell on the ground.  &quot;It was getting so uncomfortable!&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m throwing daggers with my eyes at my publicist. And they&apos;re kicking my publicist out. And I said, &apos;Get me out of here. This is crazy. This is not funny, this is discrimination. This is abusive stuff going on here!&apos;&quot;  \nCheck out these celebs goofing off\n&quot;And he says, &apos;I need you to change your clothes,&apos; and I said, &apos;No, I won&apos;t be doing that. I have to go to work ... And by the way, where&apos;s my award?&quot;  Abdul - who had to go to an Idol taping - then dashed out.  &quot;As I&apos;m going to my car, they&apos;re chasing me with cameras,&quot; she said. &quot;And I&apos;m like, &apos;Oh God, this is so awkward.&apos; And I&apos;m trying to hold a smile on my face and the guy, Bruno, is running down the street in front of the car.&quot;  &quot;It was hysterical, but it was so disturbing,&quot; added Abdul. &quot;I was so mad at my publicist at that point. I said, &apos;I can&apos;t believe you signed [the release].&apos; And my manager and attorney were trying to call the production office -- and, of course, it doesn&apos;t exist. So I was freaking out.&quot;  A year went by, she said.  Then, her manager got a call three weeks ago from a reporter who heard that she had fallen for one of Sacha Baron Cohen&apos;s stunts.  &quot;I said, &apos;I&apos;ve never done anything with Sacha Cohen ... they&apos;re wrong!&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;At 2 o&apos;clock in the morning that night, I woke up in a cold sweat. I popped my body up out of bed and I went, &apos;Holy crap! Oh my God!&apos; And that&apos;s what happened. And I&apos;m dying. Cause you don&apos;t expect it.

Jon and Hailey then looked on as Audigier posed with a sexually-explicit piece of art.\r\n\r\nThe father of eight and Audigier are planning to launch &quot;a line of children&apos;s clothing,&quot; Audigier told E!

(They also hit the chic Tahiti Beach for lunch and later popped by Prada and Hermes boutiques.)\r\n\r\n &quot;They&apos;re having fun,&quot; Audigier told E!

Two days later - while taking 8-year-old twins Cara and Mady to see Disney&apos;s Up -- he donned a pair of $150 Ed Hardy jungle-inspired jeans (featuring two angry tigers on the rear).  &quot;He seems to love our clothing,&quot; Tara Malia Gregory, the company&apos;s marketing director, previously told Usmagazine.com.  Gregory tells Us the company&apos;s demographic is males, ages 16-30.\r\n\r\nSo what kind of message is Jon -- a 32-year-old father of 8 -- trying to send?  &quot;People who wear our clothes are edgy and fashion-forward,&quot;

In an exclusive interview airing Monday evening on E! News, former Star tabloid reporter Kate Major called the 32-year-old reality show dad a &quot;liar&quot; for denying they had a romantic relationship. (Gosselin&apos;s originally slated interview on E! has been canceled, a spokesperson said earlier.)  &quot;We had plans to travel together, to live together, and to be together,&quot; Major, who dined with Gosselin in NYC and in the Hamptons throughout July, said. &quot;He made his decision in the Hamptons. He wanted to be with me.&quot;\r\nGet to know Kate Major and Jon&apos;s other women.\r\nLast week, however, Gosselin reportedly said his relationship with Major was strictly platonic. He event told Usmagazine.com that he was still with his 22-year-old girlfriend. (&quot;My heart is always with Hailey [Glassman],&quot; he told Us.)  But according to Major, Gosselin told her he was going to break up with girlfriend Glassman in order to be with her. As a result, the 26-year-old resigned from her job, citing a &quot;conflict of interest.&quot;  &quot;I was with the person I was reporting on,&quot; Major said. &quot;He&apos;s the one who actually told me to quit my job... He told me he was going to Massachusetts to break up with [Glassman]. I know the truth. He knows the truth. Unfortunately, she did not.&quot;\r\nSee photos of Jon and Haily Glassman in France.\r\nShe even said that the newly single star attempted to date them both.  &quot;He tried to two-time both of us,&quot; she said. &quot;He wasn&apos;t honest with Hailey. He needs to man up and tell the truth. I&apos;m not going to be the other woman.&quot;  She added: &quot;In no way did he tell me he was going to go parade with his ex-girlfriend.&quot;  Because Gosselin has denied they ever dated, Major said the resulting claims that she lied to get media attention have been hard to handle.\r\nLook back at photos of Jon and Kate Gosselin through the years.\r\n&quot;It&apos;s been a nightmare. I did not want to have to do this,&quot; she said. &quot;I did not want to have to sell him out, but when he makes me look like a liar, a fool, and an idiot. I have to speak out.&quot;  Major also told E!

We&apos;re in awe of their gorgeous couture gowns, dazzling over-the-top decor &#xA0;and buzz-worthy A-list guest lists. But let&apos;s be honest: the average bride-to-be is working with a much smaller budget. The good news is that there are lots of easy ways to pull off a celeb wedding for less. Here are a few of our favorite tricks:\r\nPick a Unique Venue\r\nCelebs with million-dollar budgets can afford pricey setups, flowers and decor to create the mood they want, but the average bride has to cut a few corners to pull off seamless decor. Choosing an alternative venue with built-in style (think: a museum, library, or wine bar) will cut costs on decorations while still providing the ambience you&apos;re looking for on your big day. Your wedding site will look fabulous -- simply for the cost you pay to use the space.&#xA0;\r\nGet Personal\r\nStars pull out all the stops to ensure that their weddings not only wow their guests, but also serve as an intimate affair for all. By adding personal touches to a few of your wedding details, you&apos;ll create a one-of-a-kind event your guests will never forget. Personalization doesn&apos;t have to cost a bundle if you&apos;re willing to get creative: Have wedding logos designed and made into stamps that you can use for all of your stationery and favor bags, or consider adding your favorite childhood dishes (his and hers, of course) to the menu. Your guests will love it!\r\nChat with other brides on WeddingChannel.com\r\n\r\nDon&apos;t Scrimp on the Photographer\r\nBefore you cut back on photography for your wedding, stop and ask yourself, What would Fergie do? One thing&apos;s for sure: she wouldn&apos;t get all dressed up for her wedding, complete with flawless hair and makeup, only to risk letting an amateur take her picture. The special moments you share with your guests on your big day will last forever -- caught on camera! -- so remember that you&apos;ll get what you pay for.&#xA0;\r\nDon&apos;t hire a photographer before you read this\r\nGo With a Theme\r\nAshlee Simpson married rocker Pete Wentz in a beautiful outdoor ceremony and reception in her parents&apos; backyard that featured an Alice in Wonderland theme in May 2008. From the 10,000 Black Magic roses on display to the&#xA0;\r\n&quot;Eat Me&quot; and &quot;Drink Me&quot; shooters served at the reception, the pair showed true commitment to their theme and executed it in every detail. It&apos;s a lot easier to pull off a big event when you have a theme to work with -- details come together much more easily, and your guests are guaranteed to still be talking about it on their way home!", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/celebrity-wedding-style-for-less-2009179/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 313}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/celebrity-wedding-style-for-less-2009179/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/celebrity-wedding-style-for-less-2009179/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "WeddingChannel.com: How to Say &#8220;I Do&#8221;

It was really hurtful. We were really sad to see that.&quot;\r\n\r\n Adds their onetime neighorbod, Denis: &quot;I do feel bad for the children. Hopefully they will be civil and everything for the kids sake. He needs to get away from her and run as fast as he can. The kids are the ones who will suffer, and that is the sad part.&quot;  \r\n\r\nJon&apos;s former Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School classmate Dominick Fabrizio tells Usmagazine.com: &quot;Jon thinks &apos;it is a shame what the world has come to&apos; with the paparazzi surrounding his $1.1-million home that he would not even have without that very public attention. Now that the charade is over, maybe the remaining 30 percent of the viewers still watching will realize no one should be taking life advice from Jon or Kate. I won&apos;t be lining up for an autographed book anytime soon.&quot;\r\n\r\nCritics echo similar sentiments.  Maggie, from the Gosselins Without Pity Web site, tells Us: &quot;I cannot see how announcing your divorce on national television and continuing with the show is in any way putting your children first. I feel sorry for the family, but the parents seem very immature and selfish and far more concerned about their own personal needs than what eight little confused children require emotionally. I can&apos;t believe TLC will keep running the show, but they will!&quot;\r\nAdds the Baltimore Sun&apos;s David Zurawik: &quot;I wonder if [viewers] feel exploited by TLC selling ads and making millions of dollars out of a show announcing a divorce that will not only leave eight kids with a shattered family -- but a video record of their family coming undone that will define them for the rest of their lives. I&apos;m done with this sick carnival side show.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Times&apos; Jon Caramanica sarcastically wonders if the show will  be renamed Jon Plus 8 when he&apos;s in charge, and Kate Plus 8 when she has custody.  The show will never be the same, he goes on.  &quot;Now that the Gosselins have formally initiated divorce proceedings, never again will the show&apos;s title trigger a sense of optimism and possibility, only a burden that was probably impossible all along,&quot; Caramanica writes.\r\nTell Us: What did you think of Jon and Kate announcing their split on TV?", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-kate-slammed-for-announcing-split-on-show-2009236/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-kate-slammed-for-announcing-split-on-show-2009236/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-kate-slammed-for-announcing-split-on-show-2009236/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jon &#038;

The search was conducted by members of the DEA, two Robbery - Homicide detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department and Houston Police officers.&quot;\nHe added: &quot;The search warrant authorized law enforcement to search for and seize items, including documents, they believed constituted evidence of the offense of manslaughter. Law enforcement concluded their search around 12:30pm, and left with a forensic image of a business computer hard drive and 21 documents. None of the documents taken had previously been requested by law enforcement or the L.A. Coroner&apos;s office.&quot;\nOn Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that Murray -- who was with Jackson when he suffered cardiac arrest and died June 25 -- remains a central figure in the probe.\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s pill addiction began\nIn fact, officials from the L.A. County coroner&apos;s office also have requested another interview with Murray. (Investigators have asked for medical records in addition to those Murray has already provided.)\nSee 32 photos from inside Michael Jackson&apos;s Staples Center memorial\nMurray&apos;s attorney, however, wants everyone to leave his client alone.  Ed Chernoff tells Usmagazine.com, &quot;The coroner wants to clear up the cause of death, we share that goal.&quot;  &quot;We don&apos;t have access to the most important information in this case... the toxicology report,&quot; he continued. &quot;We&apos;re still in the dark like everybody else. Based on Dr. Murray&apos;s minute-by-minute and item-by-item description of Michael Jackson&apos;s last days, he should not be a target of criminal charges.&quot;\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years\n&quot;Murray,&quot; Chernoff added, &quot;was the last doctor standing when Michael Jackson died and it seems all the fury is directed toward him.

And when I found out that, in fact, it had, it took me about 48 hours to sort of strike the balance in how I was going to approach being &#x2013; you know, being invited to this unbelievable event without actually having the proximity to Michael Jackson, personally. I&apos;d never met him.&quot;\r\nMayer performed an instrumental version of Jackson&apos;s hit &quot;Human Nature&quot; at Tuesday&apos;s memorial. He said he is glad he didn&apos;t end up singing.\r\n\r\n&quot;The decision to not sing is just out of knowing what&apos;s best for me,&quot; he said, adding that he doesn&apos;t have a strong vocal range. &quot;I think it&apos;s quite a mine field to go into trying to in any way replicate vocally what Michael Jackson has done.  And in a way, it was sort of respectfully leaving an absence, you know, sort of the presence of his absence.&quot;\r\nHe added that Usher&apos;s rendition of &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; was &quot;unbelievable.&quot;\r\n\r\nLooking back on Tuesday&apos;s memorial, Mayer said he is amazed at how &quot;humanizing it was. You know, Michael Jackson wasn&apos;t super human.  He was extra human.&quot;\r\n\r\nAdded Mayer, &quot;I think everybody who watched the service, I think by the end of it &#x2013; the best service of all was the service done to Michael Jackson to sort of render him finally as being a human being.&quot;\r\n&quot;How do I resume Twittering after a day like yesterday?&quot; the singer wrote &#x2013; on Twitter &#x2013; today. &quot;My cells feel different.

According to the British newspaper The Sun, employees at the store tried to maintain control by letting in shoppers in groups of 150 at a time, allowing them only 20 minutes of browse time.   Kate, 33, wore a red dress to the special four-hour preview session which took place at the flagship store on London&apos;s Oxford Street.   Topshop ordered huge quantities of the clothes, expecting high demand. A spokeswoman for the chain said: &quot;Most of the things have been bought in large volumes.&quot;  Nevertheless, to prevent shoppers from buying the clothes in bulk and then selling them on eBay, customers were allowed to buy just five items each.   The same rules will apply when the clothes are launched in 225 stores nationwide on Tuesday morning.   Students Anna Gordon and Molly Marot, both 13, and Lalaya Lumley, 14, ditched class early for the sale, and showed up with &quot;I Love Kate Moss&quot;&#x9D; scrawled across their foreheads in neon pen.   Moss&apos; mother, Linda, and actress Sadie Frost, were on hand to show their support, as well as socialite Peaches Geldof and supermodel Lily Cole.  Moss, who had a stint in rehab in 2005, sipped champagne with the chain&apos;s billionaire owner, Philip Green. &quot;It&apos;s exciting,&quot; he said. &quot;It wouldn&apos;t be here if we didn&apos;t believe in it.&quot;

Although that is down some from her normal weight, &quot;she&apos;s continuing to eat and trying to gain weight,&quot; Piro tells Us. &quot;It&apos;s a struggle that all cancer patients go through.&quot;\nSee stars who have beat cancer\n Piro says he has been trying to keep Fawcett&apos;s &quot;nutrition as robust as possible through treatment. She&apos;s continuing to eat as much as she can, and we&apos;re continuing to have a good array of nutritious food offerings so she can do that.&quot;  &quot;All cancer treatments tend to erode your appetite a little bit,&quot; he tells Us, adding that, under treatment, bodies don&apos;t always process food as efficiently as they might otherwise.  &quot;That&apos;s why nutrition is a very active part of any treatment,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re paying a lot of attention to that with her, and she&apos;s very aware of that.&quot;\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\nLuckily, Fawcett has &quot;lived a very healthy lifestyle all of her life, and nutrition has always been important to her, so she&apos;s continuing to work on that.&quot;

Kate said the fact that her future family vacations would be without Jon &quot;was never lost on me the entire time. It was weird to pack alone, to board the bus. It was minus Jon anyway you look at it. Many times everyday it occurred to me this will probably be how it will be.&quot;  During the second week of their trip, Kate made the kids bacon and sausage, took them to the beach and to the serpentarium. (The kids also acted out little plays which Kate said they picked up from her. As a kid, Kate used to put on shows forher grandparents. &quot;I  have very vivid memories of - are you surprised -  drama!&quot; she said.)\r\nLook back at photos of Jon and Kate Gosselin through the years Jon&apos;s absence was palpable.  &quot;Daddy&apos;s at the house,&quot; one of the kids noted; added another, &quot;I miss daddy.&quot;  See how Jon and Kate spent their hiatus\r\nKate said &quot;I can do the best I can do for my kids... but I can never make up for him.  I can&apos;t make up for the fact that he&apos;s not here. It&apos;s difficult.&quot;  While the kids were vacationing, Jon was overseeing the kitchen renovations. He said it was odd not having the little ones around. (But he said he was glad Kate wasn&apos;t there because she would have been &quot;yelling that there&apos;s a mess,&quot; which he said would have been &quot;constantly annoying.&quot;)  &quot;It&apos;s hard to talk about,&quot; Jon said of the end of his marriage. &quot;It&apos;s a fact of life; this is the way it&apos;s going to be. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever get used to it... but it&apos;s becoming more comfortable now.&quot;  Twins Mady and Cara left the trip early, as they had to finish school. They were thrilled to see their dad, but were put off by his earrings.  &quot;What&apos;s in your ears?&quot; one of them asked. Jon - whose Ed Hardy T-shirt was blurred out - said he&apos;d had his ears pierced since he was 15 and denied he was going through a mid-life crisis.  He said it&apos;s &quot;always the way I express myself. Things are coming out a lot more now. This is who I am.&quot;\r\nKate who? Meet Jon Gosselin&apos;s new women\r\nAt the end of the show, Kate returned home to see the kitchen renovations Jon had been overseeing.  &quot;I was grouchy that morning when we arrived home,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;it probably didn&apos;t seem like I was grateful.&quot; She added that the kitchen &quot;was beautiful. There was some rearranging that needed to be done... women know what i mean.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-its-constantly-annoying-when-kate-gosselin-yells-2009108/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jon-kate-b_9.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-its-constantly-annoying-when-kate-gosselin-yells-2009108/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-its-constantly-annoying-when-kate-gosselin-yells-2009108/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jon Gosselin: It&#8217;s &#8220;Constantly Annoying&#8221;

Chynna&apos;s reaction, naturally, was complete shock.\n&quot;Somebody could have dropped a piano on my head and I probably wouldn&apos;t have felt it,&quot; the singer tells Us Weekly. &quot;But I knew it was true. I mean, who in their right mind would make such a claim if it wasn&apos;t true?&quot;\nShe says the news sent her into &quot;a deep, deep sadness and depression for about 10 days. A part of me died when I found out.&quot;\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\nIn her book, Mackenzie &#x2014; who, in 2008, pleaded guilty to one count of felony cocaine possession and agreed to enter an 18-month drug deferment program &#x2014; also claims she and her father did drugs together. (She even tells Oprah Winfrey in an interview Wednesday, &quot;My father shot me up for the first time.&quot;)\nChynna confirms to Us Weekly, &quot;They were both doing drugs together.\n&quot;After long nights of heroin use, she&apos;s claiming that she once woke up and that my father was on top of her having sex with her,&quot; Chynna tells Us Weekly. &quot;Was he actually raping her?

I really don&apos;t want to change all that much.&quot;  As for her claims that she&apos;s never been kissed?  &quot;Oh, I was just joking around,&quot; she said. &quot;It was just banter and it has been blown way out of proportion. I was about to go on stage and I was very nervous.&quot;  &quot;All I want to say is that I am single at the moment, but I keep waiting,&quot; she said. &quot;I am not on the hunt.

Murray also later accompanied the ambulance to the UCLA Medical Center, where Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. PST.\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nInvestigative reporter Diane Dimond -- who has covered Michael Jackson for years -- said on CBS&apos; The Early Show Saturday Edition: &quot;If he was the only doctor on the scene and, as we heard in the 911 call, worked on Michael Jackson for quite awhile before they called 911, he may be culpable of something. I hope he&apos;s got a good lawyer.&quot;\nPolice stress that Murray is not considered to be a suspect; they just want to question him.  Although toxicology test results won&apos;t be available for up to six weeks (a preliminary autopsy showed no foul play),\nJackson family attorney Brian Oxman told Usmagazine.com he fears prescription drugs played a role. &quot;I only know that I warned them there was the misuse of prescription medications by people who were enabling him; his handlers, folks who should never have been permitted to allow him to use those medications in the manner I observed,&quot; he told Us.  \nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\nA spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner&apos;s Office has said they know that Jackson had been taking prescription drugs but needed to find out the specific medications.   Murray -- who reportedly is licensed in California, Nevada and Texas and has an office in Houston -- had treated Jackson for three years.\nTwo weeks ago -- around the time Murray reportedly announced he was shutting down his private practice -- Jackson requested that Murray be with him, according to reports. He was then hired by AEG Live, which was producing Jackson&apos;s upcoming London shows.\nDimond, the reporter who covered Jackson, said she was &quot;stunned to learn this doctor [Murray] was hired by the concert promoter (AEG Live), I guess at Michael&apos;s request. He wanted to have a doctor with him. I worked in Hollywood for many years, (for) most of the &apos;90s, and when the celebrities have a personal doctor, it&apos;s really a prescription writer; it&apos;s really a personal drug supplier.&quot;\nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nBut she said she&apos;s &quot;covered Michael Jackson since 1993. He has always had an entourage of people around him of people who do exactly what he says, or they&apos;re not there anymore. As to who is responsible, I believe in personal responsibility: You put a pill in your mouth, you did that, you put a needle in your arm, you did that. But ... there were enablers around him.&quot;\nShe believes drugs led to his death.  &quot;I&apos;m not the only one who says he&apos;s a drug addict. ... But I think so,&quot; she said. &quot;The coroner said (they saw) no visible signs of trauma, so that tells me his anorexia (Jackson reportedly weighed 125 lbs. at the time of his death) did not cause a diseased heart. They didn&apos;t say they saw a diseased heart or a bad ventricle or artery. So, it&apos;s something else that killed him.&quot;\nEven Jackson pal Liza Minnelli has her suspicions:  &quot;When the toxicology test comes out,&quot; she said on The Early Show earlier this week,  &quot;you-know-what&apos;s gonna break loose.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Conrad Murray", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/conrad-murray/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Scrutiny on Michael Jackson&#8217;s Doctor Intensifies", "datePublished": "2009-06-27T15:33:19+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:12+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 643, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#respond"]}], "description": "\"I hope he's got a good lawyer,\" says insider"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/", "name": "Scrutiny on Michael Jackson's Doctor Intensifies", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-27T15:33:19+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:12+00:00", "description": "\"I hope he's got a good lawyer,\" says insider", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scrutiny-on-michael-jacksons-doctor-intensifies-2009276/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Dr. Conrad Murray ;

Everyone was blowing me up about it.\r\nCheck out more photos of stars goofing off.\r\n&quot;After the ceremony I went back to my hotel and laughed uncontrollably for about three hours,&quot; he goes on. &quot;Especially after I saw it on air.&quot;\r\nSee photos of more embarrassing celeb moments.\r\nEminem also denied reports that a thief broke into his hotel room during the Sunday awards ceremony and swiped $60,000 and a laptop.  &quot;The only thing was that I lost a Nike watch that we were looking for,  he says. &quot;The rest it is made up -- like half the other stuff out there.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Eminem", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/eminem/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sacha Baron Cohen", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/sacha-baron-cohen/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Eminem Admits Bruno Stunt Was Staged", "datePublished": "2009-06-03T23:47:51+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:19+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 261, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#respond"]}], "description": "\"Sacha had the idea to do something outrageous,\" he says, calling himself a \"big fan\" of the comic"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/", "name": "Eminem Admits Bruno Stunt Was Staged", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-03T23:47:51+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:19+00:00", "description": "\"Sacha had the idea to do something outrageous,\" he says, calling himself a \"big fan\" of the comic", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Bruno blog", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/eminem-admits-bruno-stunt-was-staged-200936/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Eminem Admits Bruno Stunt Was Staged"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Uri would scream at Michael, you know, intensely, to stop doing this but we were getting pushed out [by the doctors].&quot;  &quot;We went to great efforts to keep the doctors away. But as soon as we said anything and it got back to Michael, Michael would have a screaming fit that we were interfering with his private life, that he knew what he was doing,&quot; Fiddes went on, adding that Jackson was &quot;in denial.&quot;\r\nSee touching photos of Michael and his kids.\r\n&quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned they have Michael&apos;s blood on their hands,&quot; he said of the doctors. &quot;They know what they&apos;ve done and there&apos;s people out there who could have helped, could have stepped in, but didn&apos;t do for financial reasons.&quot;   Fiddes said he wouldn&apos;t describe Jackson as a &quot;druggie&quot; as he did not use illegal narcotics like cocaine, but said he was addicted to painkillers.

She also said her mom&apos;s younger new beau, Charlie Hill, is &quot;the epitome of losers.&quot;   Linda shot back, telling Hilton that &quot;Brooke has always had a problem telling the truth&quot; -- including that her &quot;breasts are natural&quot; -- and even offered to &quot;take a random test.&quot;\r\nTake a look at more reality show catfights.\r\nIn a statement to Usmagazine.com, Hulk&apos;s lawyer David Houston fired back:  &quot;Brooke Hogan has spoken out in support of her father only because of her mother&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s repeated fabricated attacks on him.  She is in the unique position of knowing both parties in this litigation and she has only spoken as to what she knows to be the truth based upon her personal experience with each. Linda has refused repeated invitations by Brooke to reconcile and given these recent comments it appears a mother/daughter relationship is impossible at this time. It is sad that Linda Hogan continues to attempt to throw her family under the bus to gain publicity.\r\nCheck out more controversial reality show stars.\r\n&quot;In terms of the ongoing divorce suit, Hulk Hogan and his legal team would gladly take Linda up on her offer to submit to a legally supervised drug test and certainly Terry would do the same. We believe the results would speak for themselves and reveal that Linda&apos;s idea of a good time would definitely not be appropriate for Mass or a family restaurant.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Brooke Hogan", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/brooke-hogan/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hulk Hogan", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/hulk-hogan/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Linda Hogan", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/linda-hogan/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Hulk Hogan Fires Back at Ex-Wife Over Drug Claims", "datePublished": "2009-05-28T20:33:13+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:03+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 320, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#respond"]}], "description": "His lawyer says Linda Bollea \"continues to attempt to throw her family under the bus to gain publicity\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/", "name": "Hulk Hogan Fires Back at Ex-Wife Over Drug Claims", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-28T20:33:13+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:03+00:00", "description": "His lawyer says Linda Bollea \"continues to attempt to throw her family under the bus to gain publicity\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Hogans b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hulk-hogan-fires-back-at-ex-wife-over-drug-claims-2009285/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Hulk Hogan Fires Back at Ex-Wife Over Drug Claims"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Asked how Glassman is doing, the 32-year-old father of eight shrugged his shoulders.\nLook back at Hailey Glassman&apos;s wild past\nThe photographer teased, &quot;She ditched you in Nice?&quot;  &quot;Probably,&quot; Jon replied.  \nSee photos from Jon and Hailey&apos;s trip to France\nAsked what ex Kate thinks of party girl Glassman (the daughter of the surgeon who performed her 2006 tummy tuck), Jon said, &quot;I guess you&apos;d have to ask Kate.&quot;  He then added that he&apos;s &quot;not allowed&quot; to discuss the relationship. &quot;I don&apos;t want to get in trouble,&quot; he told photographers.\nLook back at Jon and Kate Gooselin&apos;s etter days\nLater, when asked why Glassman wasn&apos;t with him, Jon said, his girlfriend &quot;is stayin&apos;&quot; in France.  Jon said he &quot;had to come back&quot; to the United States to &quot;work.&quot;  \nSee what Kate Gooselin looked like in high school\n&quot;I had to film,&quot; he said, noting that they still have 34 episodes left to shoot. (After a month-long hiatus, the TLC show returns Aug. 3.)  Jon also briefly addressed his Ed Hardy gig. He previously said that he and Glassman had been offered a job to design a children&apos;s clothing line with Ed Hardy fashion designer Christian Audigier. But reps for the clothing company later denied his claim.  Asked for a status update, Jon simply said he was &quot;offered&quot; a gig.  \nSee more photos of Jon and ex-girlfriend Deanna Hummel\n&quot;I have to go through a lot of paper[work],&quot; he told photographers, stressing that nothing was final.  Was the offer good?  &quot;Yeah, I think so,&quot; he said, adding that the Ed Hardy brand is &quot;pretty popular.&quot;  Despite all the drama in his personal life, Jon seemed in good spirits. Photographers asked him if life was good.  As he hopped in his chauffer-driven car, he replied, &quot;Yeah.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-speaks-out-on-new-girlfriend-2009157/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Deanna Hummel", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/deanna-hummel/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hailey Glassman", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/hailey-glassman/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-speaks-out-on-new-girlfriend-2009157/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-speaks-out-on-new-girlfriend-2009157/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jon Gosselin Speaks Out on New Girlfriend", "datePublished": "2009-07-15T12:59:21+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:47+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-speaks-out-on-new-girlfriend-2009157/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 380, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-speaks-out-on-new-girlfriend-2009157/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-speaks-out-on-new-girlfriend-2009157/#respond"]}], "description": "What does ex Kate think of 22-year-old Hailey Glassman?
