Instead, feminist author Naomi Wolf examines Jolie&apos;s appeal, concluding that &quot;women both identify with her and desire her.&quot;\nSee photos of Angelina Jolie through the years\nIt&apos;s &quot;more than simply a physical response,&quot; Wolf says.  For the first time in modern culture, Jolie &quot;brings together almost every aspect of female empowerment and liberation,&quot; Wolf declares.  Above all, she says Jolie has proved that women can be viewed as a symbol of goodness, and also be seen as sexual.\nSee Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt&apos;s Cannes PDA\nShe looks at the way Jolie has transformed from a wild child to a woman with it all.  Jolie initially made headlines for her &quot;eccentric&quot; behavior, which included &quot;slightly icky&quot; smooch sessions with Billy Bob Thornton (she famously wore a vial of his blood around her neck) and kissing her brother on the lips at the 2000 Oscars.\n&quot;At that point, Jolie seemed to be simply an attention-seeking, slightly Goth upstart,&quot; Wolf writes.\nBut after she adopted Maddox in 2002 and became a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, &quot;she seemed more mature, more beautiful, and more serious,&quot; says Wolf.  At the time, &quot;Jolie revealed a new, and fairly radical, vision of single motherhood...&quot; Wolf says.\nCheck out all the places Angelina Jolie has visited\nEven when scandal broke in her life -- Brad Pitt split from Jennifer Aniston in 2005 after getting close to Jolie on the Mr. and Mrs. Smith set -- &quot;she managed the almost unheard-of task of turning the home-wrecker label into a wholesome, family-friendly triumph,&quot; says Wolf.  &quot;There was little Maddox, who was growing up and clearly enjoying tossing footballs with his mother&apos;s new boyfriend,&quot; she explains. &quot;Jolie had managed to head off the scarlet letter by giving a boy an ideal masculine counterpoint.&quot;\nSee photos of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie with their babies\nJolie also broke barriers by learning to fly.  &quot;Flying a private plane is the classic metaphor for choosing your own direction; usually, that is a guy thing to do, yet there was Jolie, with her aviator glasses on, taking flying lessons so she could blow the mind of her four-year-old son,&quot; writes Wolf.\nAs for the multiethnicity of her family, Wolf notes it&apos;s &quot;a delicious in-your-face countermove against conventions about who we are to one another and what &apos;family&apos; is expected to look like.&quot;  Says Wolf, &quot;She seems, without breaking stride, to care for half a football team of children while the rest of us tread water with our own biological offspring.&quot;  \nSee Angelina and other stars&apos; first Us Weekly cover!\nSo what&apos;s next for Jolie?  &quot;No way to tell,&quot; Wolf says, &quot;but I am certain, given the knack she has shown for tapping into this female collective unconscious, that we will watch with more than ordinary interest.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/feminist-why-all-women-desire-angelina-jolie-200986/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Angelina Jolie", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/angelina-jolie/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/feminist-why-all-women-desire-angelina-jolie-200986/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/feminist-why-all-women-desire-angelina-jolie-200986/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Feminist: Why All Women &#8220;Desire&#8221;

And if anyone out there can possibly separate his body of work from his personal demons, I think that would be the honorable thing to do.&quot;\r\nMackenzie, 49, added that her father &#x2014; with whom she says she also did drugs &#x2014; &quot;didn&apos;t set out to hurt me. He did the best with what he had. He was a damaged guy.\r\n\r\nShe also clarified reports that their relationship &#x2014; which she details in her new book, High on Arrival &#x2014; lasted 10 years.\r\n&quot;At 18, I was molested. Then maybe three years later, I started waking up later with my pants down around my ankles,&quot; she said. &quot;And then maybe two years after that, it became consensual.&quot;\r\n&quot;So to call it a 10-year relationship is not correct,&quot; she said. &quot;This was a warped event that occurred over time.&quot;\r\nThough she says she does not blame herself for her the incest, she says, &quot;I believe I have some accountability for what went down afterwards.&quot;\r\nShe previously told Oprah Winfey she became pregnant and didn&apos;t know who had fathered the child. So she had an abortion, which her father paid for, &quot;and I never let him touch me again.\r\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\r\n&quot;Some of her family is standing by her.\r\nMackenzie&apos;s half-sister Chynna tells the new Us Weekly (on newsstands now), &quot;I have pretty much come to peace with the fact that she&apos;s written this book and that it&apos;s been a cathartic experience for her.&quot;\r\nBut her step-mother Michelle Phillips has told Entertainment Tonight: &quot;Mackenzie&apos;s drug addiction for 35 years has been the result of many unpleasant experiences. Whether her relationship with her father is delusional or not, it is an unfortunate circumstance and very hurtful for our entire family.&quot;\r\nDespite the criticism, Mackenzie said on the Today show, &quot;the outpouring &#xA0;of support from other incest survivors has been phenomenal.&quot;\r\n&quot;This is a subject that is so incredibly taboo, as it should be, but there needs to be a dialogue about it,&quot;

I&apos;m very aware of that. I think there were definitely some feelings there when he left for the show ... and that&apos;s human nature and I understand that.\nSee photos of couples who split after appearing together on a reality show.\n&quot;I feel very sorry for the girls who are broken-hearted, because I know how that feels,&quot; continues Harris, who was dumped by Jason Mesnick on Season 13 of The Bachelor.  &quot;The way that they have dealt with it, to bring up things from the past that don&apos;t apply to my relationship with Ed, it&apos;s making them, I believe, look a little bit foolish....&quot; she goes on.\nDespite admitting tears, Harris says Swiderski&apos;s dalliances are &quot;not important to [her].&quot; She says she still plans to move to Chicago next month to be closer to her fiance.\nSee reality TV&apos;s biggest catfights.\n&quot;I am not affected by this at all,&quot; she says. &quot;We really plan on trying to get out of the limelight and trying to get on with our lives.

Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers were among the acts that performed at the Kids&apos; Inaugural Concert, an invitation-only event for military families and other area children at the Lincoln Memorial on Monday.   Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, offered small waves to the crowd before taking their seats in the front row with their J. Crew-clad mother, Michelle Obama, and Vice President-elect Joe Biden&apos;s four granddaughters.\r\nLook back at photos of all the first children.\r\n&quot;What an amazing show,&quot; Michelle Obama -- who also signed autographs -- told the crowd. &quot;You kids are the future of this great nation. At this moment in our nation&apos;s history, we wanted you to be able to join in this celebration.&quot;  The crowd went wild for the Jonas Brothers.\r\nCheck out inauguration party pics!\r\nBoth Malia and Sasha jumped up when the boys took the stage and started clapping. They danced along with their mom and Biden&apos;s grandchildren. Sasha even took several steps ahead of Michelle to take a picture. She was working the camera as the boys, one by one, walked to the section of the stage nearest to them.\r\nSee what your favorite teen stars looked like two years ago.\r\nThe girls were equally excited about Lovato as they sang along to her songs. They also laughed as George Lopez took the stage and cracked jokes with the crowd.    Another show highlight? Miley Cyrus.   She dedicated her inspirational tune &quot;The Climb&quot; to the Obama daughters.  &quot;You girls must be awfully proud of your dad &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201D; and so am I,&quot; said Cyrus, who sang with her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, on stage.  After her performance, an out-of-breath Cyrus got off stage to shake hands with the Obama girls.", "isPartOf": {"@id":

I mean, my knees are rotten bad- I refused to wear knee pads too many times when I was doing stunts, and I just clobbered them up a bit. I am an old man in a young man&apos;s body.&quot;  \nSee your favorite child stars all grown up\nRadcliffe is currently prepping for the sixth installment, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, due July 15. (He is currently shooting the two-part finale, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in England.)  He says it&apos;s interesting to see how he&apos;s evolved personally with the character.\n&quot;When I started out at the age of 10 or 11,&quot; he says. &quot;I was essentially saying the lines as I myself would say them. When I became aware that that&apos;s what I was doing, at 13 or 14, it didn&apos;t make sense to change, because it would suddenly be a dramatic shift in the character.&quot;  \nSee Daniel Radcliffe&apos;s Lego character - and more!\nRadcliffe reportedly banked $25 million for the most recent Potter flick and is said to be worth at least twice that, according to Parade.  &quot;I think it&apos;s amazing,&quot; he says of his fortune. &quot;I have been very, very fortunate. But I&apos;m not going to spend it on flashy cars or particular extravagances. What it does in terms of my career, which is how I like to look at it, it gives me the thing that George Clooney has, where he can go off and do a big-budget movie like Ocean&apos;s Eleven, make a lot of money for it, and then go and do stuff that won&apos;t pay as much. It gives you room to maneuver, basically. It means I can relax, and I think that&apos;s the best thing it can do. It&apos;s one thing in my life that I am incredibly fortunate not to have to worry about. Money will never be the focus for me.

Inside, the James Joyce poem &quot;At That Hour&quot; was featured:  Play on, invisible harps, unto Love, Whose way in heaven is aglow At that hour when soft lights come and go, Soft sweet music in the air above And in the earth below.\nAccording to the program, the service opened with an &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; procession.  Redmond then gave the service&apos;s first reading, with O&apos;Neal next reading the 23rd Psalm.\nThe Richard Marx-Linda Thompson song &quot;To Where You Are&quot; played before Alana Stewart and Fawcett&apos;s physician, Dr. Lawrence Piro, gave eulogies.\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\nFawcett passed away at age 62 at Saint John&apos;s Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif., last Thursday -- just hours before Michael Jackson.

It was a constant thought on my mind,&quot; she told cameras from the armchair, which replaced the loveseat she used to share with Jon in prior seasons. &quot;While the kids had a great time, they mentioned numerous times they wished daddy could have been there.&quot;\nJon wasn&apos;t present at all in the second episode, which featured Kate and the kids camping in their backyard. The family also took a dip in the backyard pool, where Kate showed off her second bright blue bikini.   &quot;This was my first official turn with the kids. It didn&apos;t feel very different,&quot; she said. Later, Kate admitted, &quot;It&apos;s a very difficult time right now. Those words don&apos;t even cover it. My goal is to make it as easy and painless for the kids.&quot;\nSee the Gosselin family album.\nKate struggled to set up two tents while the kids taunted her that &quot;daddy did it different.&quot; One of the twins told cameras, &quot;We&apos;d probably die if we lived in nature with her.&quot; A production assistant ended up setting up the second tent.

Two lawsuits claiming he owes $240,000 more for unpaid equipment are pending in Nevada courts.  \nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\nAlso, Murray&apos;s home is in &quot;pre-foreclosure&quot; after he failed to make payments on his $1.66 million loan, records show. He stopped paying the $15,000-per-month mortgage in December and could lose the home by November, said Mary Hunt, the foreclosure officer handling the case.\nNeither Jackson nor AEG Live, the promoter for the London concerts that was prepared to pay him $150,000 a month, paid Murray for the two months the doctor worked for the pop star, according to Chernoff.\n&quot;Dr. Murray has lost the ability to make a living as a result of this investigation,&quot; Chernoff said. &quot;His hope is he can forestall foreclosure until he can once again begin working as a doctor.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Court Records Reveal Michael Jackson&#8217;s Doctor Was in Debt", "datePublished": "2009-07-31T23:54:47+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:23+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 469, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#respond"]}], "description": "Dr. Conrad Murray owed at least $780,000 in outstanding mortgage payments and loans"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/", "name": "Court Records Reveal Michael Jackson's Doctor Was in Debt", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-31T23:54:47+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:23+00:00", "description": "Dr. Conrad Murray owed at least $780,000 in outstanding mortgage payments and loans", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Murray jackson b_0", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/court-records-reveal-michael-jacksons-doctor-was-in-debt-2009317/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Court Records Reveal Michael Jackson&#8217;s Doctor Was in Debt"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Just ask her.\n&quot;I think I&apos;m pretty sexy in it,&quot; the actress, 23, said at the Comic-Con press conference for the movie (out Sept. 18). &quot;The movie is SO sexy! You better put on your sexy shoes for this movie!&quot;  \nSee Megan Fox&apos;s hottest red carpet looks\nIn the film, in which Fox eats people, &quot;there&apos;s sort of a hint of, a little bit of a lesbian relationship that happens. There&apos;s a girl-on-girl kiss.\n&quot;And beyond that, before every kill there is a seduction that occurs,&quot; Fox continues. &quot;The boys have to be seduced to get in close enough to the dead girl in order for her to devour them.&quot;  \nSee more photos of women who get close on film\nFox says she loved starring in the flick because &quot;it&apos;s so unapologetic and completely inappropriate at all times.&quot;  But it was harder to film than Transformers, which she slammed as &quot;not about acting&quot; -- just special effects.  \nCheck out pics of Hollywood&apos;s scream queens\n&quot;There are no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give.  So if it&apos;s terrible, you&apos;re going to know that it&apos;s terrible!&quot; Fox says. &quot;That of course is intimidating, but I think the character was so much fun for me.  And I wasn&apos;t really sure what I was doing. I was just trying to have fun with it.\n&quot;I sort of felt like I was being able to make fun of my own image, sort of, as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be,&quot; she continues. &quot;I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it worked.&quot;  Usually, Fox is &quot;not a fan&quot; or horror movies.  \nCan you guess the star leg?\n&quot;I actually have a very intense fear of the dark,&quot; she admits. &quot;The last horror movie I saw -- I think it was called The Tooth Fairy -- was in 2005, and I was 15 years old. After I saw it, I slept with my mother for two weeks afterwards!&quot;\nBut she pounced on the opportunity to overcome her fear.  &quot;I think for me, to be able to play something that I would normally be frightened by is really intriguing and interesting,&quot; she says.\nWatching a scream scene in the movie still horrified her.   &quot;It frightened me, and it shook me up for like five minutes,&quot; she admits.\nShe doesn&apos;t mind freaking out an audience.  &quot;It&apos;s cool to see myself being able to scare people, because I&apos;m just a little girl,&quot;

On Wednesday, they went jet-skiing near Tybee Island.  &quot;No comment,&quot; she said when asked about the outing, though she did admit, &quot;I am a jet ski demon!&quot;\r\n\r\nAs for her new nose piercing, she said she is not ready to get &quot;slammed&quot; for the body art.  &quot;I&apos;ll let people think what they will,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope no one is upset at me for doing it. I think it&apos;s lame for it to be such a big deal because ... it&apos;s just temporary. You can take it out.&quot;  \r\n\r\nWhat prompted the piercing?  &quot;I am a huge Kelly Clarkson fan,&quot; she said. &quot;And I loved when she had her nose pierced.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Kelly Clarkson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kelly-clarkson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Miley Cyrus", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/miley-cyrus/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nick Jonas", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/nick-jonas/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Miley Cyrus: Nick Jonas and I Have &#8220;Reconnected&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-06-12T18:25:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:29+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 504, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#respond"]}], "description": "She also says she hopes she won't get \"slammed\" for getting her nose pierced"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/", "name": "Miley Cyrus: Nick Jonas and I Have \"Reconnected\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-12T18:25:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:29+00:00", "description": "She also says she hopes she won't get \"slammed\" for getting her nose pierced", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Miley Cyrus and Nick Jonas on April 11, 2009 in West Hollywood CA.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-nick-jonas-and-i-have-reconnected-2009126/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Miley Cyrus: Nick Jonas and I Have &#8220;Reconnected&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

She is also petitioning to take over the children&apos;s estate. Its value is listed as &quot;unknown&quot; in the filing.  The filings do not state whether Michael left a will.  A hearing has been set for Aug 3.  TMZ.com first reported the news Monday.  Michael has two children with ex Rowe --Prince, 12, and Paris, 11. His third child,  Prince Michael II, 7, was born to a surrogate (the mother&apos;s identity was never revealed). The court filings Monday list her whereabouts as &quot;unknown.&quot;\nUsmagazine.com confirmed last week that the children have been staying with Katherine  at the family&apos;s Encino, Calif., estate since their father&apos;s June 25 death.\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s appearance has changed through the years\nOn Monday&apos;s Today show, the Jacksons&apos; attorney Londell McMillan said there isn&apos;t &quot;anybody who thinks that there is someone better&quot; than Katherine Jackson to have custody.  Said McMillan, &quot;She is a very loving host of other grandchildren.&quot;  Over the weekend, Katherine was spotted at a Los Angeles Target stocking up on toys, sleeping bags and other supplies.  McMillan added that the family hasn&apos;t heard from Rowe, who gave up her custody rights to the children after she and Jackson divorced in 1999.  In a statement over the weekend, Rowe&apos;s attorney, Marta Almli, said: &quot;Ms. Rowe&apos;s only thoughts at this time have been regarding the devastating loss Michael&apos;s family has suffered. Ms. Rowe requests that Michael&apos;s family, and particularly the children, be spared such harmful, sensationalist speculation and that they be able to say goodbye to their loved one in peace.&quot;\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nJackson&apos;s manager, Frank DiLeo, said on ABC&apos;s Good Morning America that the children are doing fine - but grieving.  He said he was the one who told the children their father had died.  &quot;They knew when I came into the room,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m sure they just saw it on my face. They said, &apos;say it&apos;s not true,&apos; and I just said, &apos;I&apos;m sorry.&apos;&quot;\nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nRowe isn&apos;t holding up well, either.  &quot;She is inconsolable,&quot; her former attorney Iris Finsilver told Us last week. &quot;She will always love Michael and she always considered him a dear friend.&quot;  Tell Us: Who should get

Usmagazine.com caught up with Sparks during a break from rehearsing for the group number to get the scoop on his routine&apos;s concept, and find out why he opted not to choreograph individual routines this season.\r\nUsmagazine.com: You&apos;re choreographing this week&apos;s group number for the top 18. Tell Us about the concept. \r\nShane Sparks: I&apos;m using a song called &quot;Elevator&quot; by Flo Rida and doing a 2008 &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; vibe. Basically, the dancers are kind of like gangsters. It&apos;s going to be a lot of sexy stuff, floating and fighting-type scenes and we&apos;ve got booty stuff going on because I&apos;m sure America misses the booty! [Laughs] I&apos;m just trying to do something creative and different. I want to give the people what they want, you know?\r\nUs: How did Fox approach you to return? Did fan excitement play a role?\r\nSS: This is what I hear. I didn&apos;t want to leave the show; I hated that I couldn&apos;t do both [SYTYCD and America&apos;s Best Dance Crew, on which Sparks is a judge]. But I heard that Nigel [Lythgoe] and [Dance Crew producer] Randy [Jackson] got together and talked about it. Randy was okay with me doing both shows, but MTV wanted me exclusively. Randy and Nigel tried to work it out, and that made me feel really good to know that that they were willing to talk to the top people and at least ask for me to choreograph.\r\nUs: What would it take for you to choreograph individual routines? \r\nSS: Right now I am really happy doing group numbers. I didn&apos;t want to do the competitive side of it anymore because I didn&apos;t want my choreography to be judged; I never really liked that. If my routines don&apos;t go over well, I go home and I go on YouTube or MySpace and it&apos;s like,&quot;What is that?&quot; I prefer to do group numbers, because I am judged on it, but I get to pick the music, the style, the clothing. I have got all of the dancers to work with, so I&apos;m not trying to take two dancers and turn them into hip-hop dancers. I have 18 dancers, so I find the hip hop dancers and have them do what I want them to do hip-hop wise, I find a jazz dancer and have them do what I want in that world. In that way, I can bring it all together.\r\nUs: Switching gears, what do you think of this season&apos;s new hip-hop choreographers, Napoleon and Tabitha? Mary Murphy said that their choreography is &quot;cotton candy hip-hop.&quot;\r\n SS: Tabitha and Napoleon are a good combination and they&apos;re good for the show.  It&apos;s OK for Mary to say that. I understand why she said that, because sometimes when you&apos;re a hip-hop choreographer and you&apos;re dealing with people who are ballroom dancers or ballet dancers, it&apos;s really hard to get the funk out of them because they don&apos;t have that natural feel or ability. You have to water the routine down so it can look and feel good to them and the audience can enjoy it.   \r\nUs: Lastly, do you keep in touch with any former contestants?\r\nSS: The only time I keep in touch with them is if I have a project. I have Cedric [Gardner, season 3] coming in for some things for Americas Best Dance Crew and he auditioned for a movie I&apos;m doing called The Jump Off. Hopefully he&apos;ll be in the movie. If not, I&apos;ll have something else for him. Do you remember Brian Gaynor [who auditioned in season 3]? He plays the janitor in the movie. It&apos;s like High School Musical meets You Got Served. Brian&apos;s in a scene where he is going to be cleaning up the hallway floor and somebody comes through and he just starts breaking out into his thing, using mops and stuff - its going to be insane!", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Randy Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/randy-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Shane Sparks Returns to So You Think You Can Dance!", "datePublished": "2008-06-17T21:13:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:24+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 750, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#respond"]}], "description": "The fan favorite hip-hop choreographer returns for the June 19 episode"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/", "name": "Shane Sparks Returns to So You Think You Can Dance!", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2008-06-17T21:13:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:24+00:00", "description": "The fan favorite hip-hop choreographer returns for the June 19 episode", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Choreographer Shane Sparks (R) teaches Hip-Hop to a student from LA's BEST (Better Educated Students for Tomorrow), an after-school enrichment program in Los Angeles, on Sunday, Aug. 5.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shane-sparks-returns-to-iso-you-think-you-can-dancei-2008176/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Shane Sparks Returns to So You Think You Can Dance!"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Given the length of filming for Eclipse, never did I fathom I would lose the role over a 10-day overlap.   \nCheck out more than 15 pics from Twilight.\n&quot;I was happy with my contract with Summit and was fully prepared to continue to honor it. Summit chose simply to recast the part,&quot; she continued. &quot;I am greatly saddened that I will not get to complete my portrayal of Victoria for the Twilight audience. This is a story, a theatrical journey and a character that I truly love and about which I am very passionate.\n&quot;I will be forever grateful to the fan support and loyalty I&apos;ve received since being cast for this role, and I am hurt deeply by Summit&apos;s surprising decision to move on without me.

State Labor Commissioner Angela Bradstreet said that the entertainment site failed to take out the required permits before videotaping two of the octuplets -- Noah and Isaiah -- without safeguards to protect their health and welfare.  She alleged that the site videotaped the infants at hours and for periods of time banned by state regulations and failed to provide a supervisor to watch over them during taping sessions.\r\nFind out what Octo-Mom does all day.\r\n&quot;These babies were put at risk and exposed to conditions that violated California labor laws,&quot; Bradstreet said. &quot;In this case, we are dealing with premature babies.&quot;  And according to Department of Labor spokesman Dean Fryer, those four violations -- which could carry penalties of as much as $3,000 -- only occurred on March 17 and involve the very first videos of the newborns when they arrived home from the hospital.\r\nSee photos of the octuplets when they were first born.\r\n&quot;We still have an ongoing investigation into activity that occurred after that date,&quot; he told Us.  He also said that Allred has been helpful in the state&apos;s pursuit.  &quot;We interviewed for her as part of our investigation,&quot; he said.   RadarOnline.com -- which has posted more than 100 items about Suleman and her babies -- said in a statement that like other newsgathering organizations, it is not required to obtain permits and is not restricted to certain hours in its journalistic pursuits.

Authorities think Jenkins walked across the border.  Fiore&apos;s mother Lisa Lepore says her daughter, a former model, met Jenkins in Vegas in March and wed him shortly after. In May, Lepore says the couple &quot;had a big blowout&quot; and Jasmine &quot;had the marriage annulled.&quot;\nCheck out Hollywood&apos;s ugliest divorces of all time.\n In June, Jenkins was charged with a misdemeanor count of &quot;battery constituting domestic violence&quot; for hitting Fiore in the arm.

With Regis and Kelly, Regis Philbin caught Kate off guard when he told her he thinks Jon will ask for her back and they&apos;ll &quot;live happily ever after.&quot;\r\n&#xA0;\r\nKate paused, sighed and then paused again.\r\n&quot;You know, we definitely have different goals at this point,&quot; she said. &quot;A lot has changed, a lot of unexpected things have came up. It&apos;s not ideal and I can&apos;t say that I think you&apos;re right at all.&quot;\r\n\r\nPhilbin then asked Kate how she would respond if Jon told her to forget about the past and that he wanted to rebuild a future together.\r\n&quot;I don&apos;t think I can answer that,&quot; she replied. Later, she added, &quot;We can only go forward; we can&apos;t go back.&quot;\r\nBut she said she is aiming to film more scenes with her ex on the show. (Viewers might agree: This past Monday&apos;s show attracted only 3.5 million viewers &#x2013; down nearly 4 million viewers from the week before.)\r\n\r\n&quot;It&apos;s still going to be a lot of &apos;Jon and Kate,&apos; but it&apos;s going to be &apos;Jon and the kids&apos; and &apos;Kate and the kids,&apos; she said. &quot;I still hold out hope that it will be times where it will be &apos;Jon and Kate and the kids.&apos; My main goal is to do holidays and things together. I don&apos;t know, really. I&apos;m going into uncharted territory sort of. I&apos;m going to be with the kids every second I get.&quot;\r\nShe admitted that while some days are &quot;better&quot; than others, &quot;most days are still difficult. At this point [the split] is starting to sink in.&quot;  \r\n\r\nShe said they don&apos;t have a &quot;set schedule&quot; for custody of their eight kids.\r\n&quot;It&apos;s based on what I&apos;m doing versus what he&apos;s doing,&quot; she said. &quot;Surprisingly that is the first peaceful part of it. We do work really well with the kids. I do live there with them, so whoever thought there was a condo or apt out there for me, false!&quot;\r\nShe continued, &quot;I do live in the house with the kids and I disappear on my days off.... This is certainly not the life I envisioned for myself. What doesn&apos;t kill you makes you stronger. I&apos;m going to be pretty strong until I die.&quot;\r\nKate also mentioned her buzzed-about hair do.\r\n\r\n&quot;It&apos;s just easy,&quot; she said. &quot;There&apos;s a Halloween costume out there. It&apos;s a wig. I&apos;m actually going to get that wig and put it on a friend of mine so they&#xC2;&#xA0;can go to the left and I can go to the right, without the paparazzi.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id":

It&apos;s hurtful to my family and if I was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship, it would be hurtful to her. There was another story claiming I was a neat freak. If I had to choose one of the two, I think I&apos;d rather be a sex addict. It&apos;s not funny and I&apos;ll be glad when it goes away.&quot;\r\nIn September, Evan Handler shared well wishes for his Californication co-star.

A hearing is set for Aug. 3 to determine if she&apos;ll become their permanent guardian.  \nRevisit the King of Pop&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nJudge Mitchell Beckloff rejected Katherine&apos;s request to serve as the temporary guardian of the children&apos;s estate.  Katherine filed a petition Monday asking the court to appoint her as guardian of Jackson&apos;s three children.\nThe petition states the kids have &quot;no relationship with their biological mother,&quot; Debbie Rowe, according to TMZ.com, which first reported the news.  Katherine also filed a petition to become the administrator of Michael&apos;s estate to ensure his children are its beneficiaries, the Associated Press reports.\nJoe Jackson has joined in the petition to attempt to name his wife as the keeper of Michael&apos;s estate.  Michael has two children with ex Rowe --Prince, 12, and Paris, 11. His third child, Prince Michael II, 7, was born to a surrogate (the mother&apos;s identity was never revealed). The court filings Monday list her whereabouts as &quot;unknown.&quot;\nLook back on Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nUs confirmed last week that the children have been staying with Katherine at the family&apos;s Encino, Calif., estate since their father&apos;s June 25 death.\nOn Monday&apos;s Today show, the Jacksons&apos; attorney Londell McMillan said there isn&apos;t &quot;anybody who thinks that there is someone better&quot; than Katherine Jackson to have custody.  Said McMillan, &quot;She is a very loving host of other grandchildren.&quot;\nOver the weekend, Katherine was spotted at a Los Angeles Target stocking up on toys, sleeping bags and other supplies.  McMillan added that the family hasn&apos;t heard from Rowe, who gave up her custody rights to the children after she and Jackson divorced in 1999.\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years\nIn a statement over the weekend, Rowe&apos;s attorney, Marta Almli, said: &quot;Ms. Rowe&apos;s only thoughts at this time have been regarding the devastating loss Michael&apos;s family has suffered. Ms. Rowe requests that Michael&apos;s family, and particularly the children, be spared such harmful, sensationalist speculation and that they be able to say goodbye to their loved one in peace.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Katherine Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/katherine-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Katherine Jackson Granted Temporary Guardianship of Kids", "datePublished": "2009-06-29T17:34:44+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:15+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 413, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#respond"]}], "description": "A judge rejected her bid to become guardian of the children's estate"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/", "name": "Katherine Jackson Granted Temporary Guardianship of Kids", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-29T17:34:44+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:15+00:00", "description": "A judge rejected her bid to become guardian of the children's estate", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Katherine debbie b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katherine-jackson-granted-temporary-guardianship-of-kids-2009296/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Katherine Jackson Granted Temporary Guardianship of Kids"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

He adds that the King of Pop is probably better off dead.\n&quot;He was a freak,&quot; Everett, 50, tells U.K.&apos;s The Mirror. &quot;He looked like a character from Shrek. He was a black to white minstrel. He was crucified by that court case when he was accused of child molestation - that killed him.&quot;\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed\nJackson &quot;personified the pain and anxiety of a black man in a slave country,&quot; Everett continues. &quot;We all watched as he changed from black to white. He was living performance art. I think it was fortuitous that he died.&quot;\nOf Jackson&apos;s 50 London comeback performances, Everett says, &quot;It wouldn&apos;t have mattered how good or bad he was.

He says he &quot;fell out of love with America after 9/11.&quot;\n&quot;Straight afterwards, this cruel and nasty city was hit with a sudden wave of compassion,&quot; he explains. &quot;Everyone looked out for everyone. I thought that could be the beginning of something amazing.&quot;\n&quot;It felt like it was a new beginning but then the rain started and President Bush came in and began the war,&quot; he continues. &quot;The whole country just changed and became completely alien to me. We came to America as kids because England was stuffy and constipated. The U.S. used to be a breath of fresh air but Bush changed all that.&quot;\nAmerica &quot;is a weird place now,&quot; Everett says, adding that &quot;cartoons are more realistic than real-life. Family Guy, The Simpsons and Shrek are much more believable than action films. People react to cartoons rather than life.

Gibson opened the show riding in on a horse and wearing a Viking helmet. He then introduced Fight Club, which was inducted into the Guy Hall of Fame.  &quot;Thanks, sugar t***!&quot; Pitt told Gibson as he accepted the honor. (When he was arrested for DUI, Gibson reportedly called a female police officer &quot;sugar t***.&quot;)\nDid you know these stars (including Brad Pitt) had secret stripper pasts?\n Pitt, Norton and Fincher then read all of the bad reviews of Fight Club and cheered at each criticism.

After garnering just 1.1 million viewers for its second and final episode, Variety reports the Wednesday night timeslot will be filled by reruns of the network's Melrose Place reboot, featuring Ashlee Simpson-Wentz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoosely based on executive producer Ashton Kutcher's days as a model, Life featured Barton, 23, as a supermodel and veteran of the high-fashion circuit who is struggling to keep on top and is danger of slipping. Corbin Bleu and Elle MacPherson also starred.\r\n\r\nThe series has faced an uphill battle from its inception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July, production on the New York City-based series was postponed after Barton was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for psychiatric evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe actress, who rose to fame as the rebellious Marissa Cooper on The O.C., later denied claims she had a mental breakdown, instead claiming her stay was a result of a \"terrible\" wisdom tooth surgery.\"", "isPartOf": {"@id":

When police intervened, she broke down in tears and stormed off. (A rep for Boyle tells London&apos;s The Times that the incident was caused by a pesky reporter. &quot;A journalist from a tabloid paper provoked her, the police just happened to be at the hotel and escorted said journalist out after making sure Susan was OK,&quot; the spokesperson told the paper.)\nCheck out these unforgettable celeb meltdowns\nIt wasn&apos;t her only outburst this week: Boyle also reportedly cussed at a television set in the hotel bar Tuesday after she heard judge Morgan praise rival singer Shaheen Jafargholi, 12, on Britain&apos;s Got Talent. (Her rep denies the incident.)\nThink Susan Boyle&apos;s makeover is impressive? Check out these stunning celeb transformations!\nOn CBS&apos; The Early Show Thursday, Morgan said he&apos;s &quot;feeling more supportive&quot; of Boyle &quot;today than I was before, because I feel really sorry for Susan.  &quot;From what I hear,&quot; he told co-anchor Maggie Rodriguez, &quot;she&apos;s been in tears the last two days. She even threatened to leave the show yesterday at one stage, because of the sheer amount of pressure on her.\nSee the most talked-about reality stars of all time\n &quot;And you have to remember with Susan, she&apos;s a 48-year-old lady from a tiny village in Scotland who has never been exposed to anything like this kind of attention. And I think she&apos;s really feeling the heat.  &quot;The hotel she&apos;s in is crawling in tourists, crawling in the media. I think maybe she overreacted. I don&apos;t know what happened. She denies, apparently, some of the things that have been reported.\nSee more scandalous moments on reality TV\n&quot;But either way, I know she&apos;s feeling a lot of pressure, and I think that most people watching this show and hearing about this will feel natural sympathy toward her.

I want to tell you that this discussion, however, is between Michael, his children and this person.  It&apos;s not to be discussed who the father is over national television.&quot;\r\nOn June 30, Klein said through his lawyer that he was &quot;aware of media reports&quot; about the paternity but, &quot;because of patient confidentiality&quot; would &quot;make no statement on any reports or allegations.&quot;\r\nUs Weekly has confirmed from multiple sources that Klein is Prince and Paris&apos; biological father. Debbie Rowe, who worked for Klein for 23 years, is the biological mother. In the new issue of Us Weekly, Klein&apos;s longtime partner Stephen Price says that the kids called Klein &quot;Uncle Arnold,&quot; and came along with Price as a guest to the Jackson house last Christmas.\r\nThe new issue also includes a 2003 interview with Debbie Rowe where she told Us Weekly&apos;s Ian Drew about her decision to carry Jackson&apos;s babies, &quot;[Michael] said no at first.

She was supposed to celebrate with a Ken and Barbie-themed party. (On Simpson&apos;s birthday, Romo spent the night at Los Angeles hot spot My House.)\r\n&quot;She canceled her party because of this,&quot; the source tells Us. &quot;She&apos;s doing OK.&quot;\r\n&quot;Barbie party didn&apos;t happen, but I turned 29 and feel like I am on top of the world yelling I LOVE GETTING OLDER!&quot; she wrote on her Twitter page Saturday.\r\nLater, she wrote: &quot;Everyone needs to know that hope floats...grab the strings and pull it back to you... Falling asleep with my mom and the dogs. Please, Lord, give all of my beautiful fans, friends, enemies, and family rest. Bring all of us peace.&quot;\r\nA close friend of Romo&apos;s tells Us of the split: &quot;It&apos;s been a long time coming.&quot;\r\nStill, another source tells Us the volatile couple could always get back together. &quot;They go from one fight right into another, without a second break,&quot; the source tells Us. &quot;It&apos;s always something with Jessica.&quot;\r\nSimpson&apos;s rep had no comment. Simpson - who turned 29 July 10 - began dating Romo, 29, in November 2007 -- around the two-year anniversary of her split with Nick Lachey (who, incidentally, recently split with his girlfriend Vanessa Minnillo).\r\nLook back at Jessica Simpson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\r\nSimpson said she was watching a Cowboys game with her family when a segment on the quarterback aired, during which he said Simpson was his celebrity dream crush.\r\n&quot;My family was like, &apos;Did you just hear that?&apos;&quot; Simpson told the June 2008 issue of Glamour. &quot;His picture came up, and I&apos;m like, &apos;He&apos;s really cute.&apos; Then I heard [that I was his crush], and I&apos;m like, &apos;Oh my gosh!&apos;&quot;\r\nSee photos of more celebs who have landed their crushes\r\nThey later met after a pal introduced Romo to her dad, Joe. Simpson said she and Romo then began flirting &quot;over e-mail and on the phone.&quot;\r\nOn their first date, Simpson told Glamour, &quot;I had butterflies that you would not imagine. I wanted to puke in the cup holder ... It took me forever to put together an outfit!&quot;\r\nSee Jessica Simpson&apos;s style hits -- and misses!\r\nHe tried to kiss her on their first date. &quot;I was taken aback....\r\n&quot;The fact that this guy, on our first date, in the first 10 minutes of dinner, wanted to lean over the table and say, &apos;This is my girl, and I want to kiss her&apos; -- our first kiss in front of everybody -- was awesome,&quot; she recalled to Glamour.\r\nDuring their relationship, Simpson credited Romo with helping her change as a person.\r\n&quot;He reintroduced me to myself,&quot; Simpson told Glamour. &quot;I thought that I had to be deeper, more profound and more artsy. You change with the guys you date.&quot;\r\nSee every single Us Weekly cover Jessica Simpson has appeared on\r\n&quot;Tony taught me that because he loves me [as me]. He made me feel comfortable [being myself] again,&quot; she said.\r\n(She even dedicated the tune &quot;You&apos;re My Sunday&quot; to the football star while recently touring.)\r\nSee Jessica Simpson and other stars who&apos;ve engaged in major PDA!\r\nDespite professing her love for Romo, their relationship underwent its share of scrutiny. Last year Simpson was nicknamed &quot;Yoko Romo&quot; by Cowboys fans who thought she was bad luck to Romo&apos;s football performance. Appearing on the Late Show With David Letterman, she even joked that she&apos;ll never again wear her pink No.9 jersey to games.\r\nLook back at Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey&apos;s cheesiest moments\r\nSimpson - who the subject of much debate after she showed off a fuller figure earlier this year - told this June&apos;s Vanity Fair that they didn&apos;t let the criticism get to them.\r\nLook back at the many loves of Jessica and Ashlee Simpson\r\n&quot;We don&apos;t let it affect our relationship,&quot; she said. &quot;If we did, we wouldn&apos;t be together, because it happened at the very beginning. Dating the Cowboys quarterback comes with hype, the fans, the bloggers, but I&apos;ve never dated a guy that was more simple. I&apos;m always there for him after a game, and he knows he has me to come home to.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jessica Simpson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jessica-simpson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tony Romo", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/tony-romo/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jessica Simpson Dumped by Tony Romo", "datePublished": "2009-07-13T18:57:40+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:43+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 809, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#respond"]}], "description": "He calls it quits the night before her 29th birthday July 10, Us has confirmed"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/", "name": "Jessica Simpson Dumped by Tony Romo", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-13T18:57:40+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:43+00:00", "description": "He calls it quits the night before her 29th birthday July 10, Us has confirmed", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Tony Romo and Jessica Simpson at the AT&T National hosted by Tiger Woods at the Congressional Country Club on July 1, 2009 in Bethesda, MD.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Jessica Simpson Dumped by Tony Romo"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

County Coronor&apos;s Office says more tests are necessary to determine the official cause of death.  \nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life.\nDuring a press conference this afternoon, Craig Harvey, the chief coronor investigator, said the cause of death was deferred because additional tissue studies and testing &#x2013; including toxicology, neuropathology, pulmonary and others &#x2013; must be completed. These tests should be completed in four to six weeks, he said. Once those are completed, the ongoing case can be closed.\nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments.\nStill, the autopsy, which took three hours to complete, revealed that Jackson&apos;s body suffered no external trauma and there was &quot;no indication of foul play,&quot; Harvey said.\nHe added that Jackson, however, had been taking &quot;some prescription medications&quot; but could not confirm what those drugs were.\nJackson, who suffered cardiac arrest at his rented L.A. home Thursday, was pronounced dead inside the hospital&apos;s emergency room at 2:26 p.m. PST, he said. He added that because no doctor signed the death certificate, a coronor at L.A.&apos;s coronor&apos;s office did instead.  \nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon.\nHe also said that Jackson&apos;s body is ready to be released, but the family has not yet chosen a mortuary. Thus, it is unclear if he will be released tonight or sometime later.\nCoronor Ed Winter conducted the autopsy and distributed the information earlier to the family.\nBefore the press conference, fans gathered. They sang famous Michael Jackson songs, and some sold T-shirts that said &quot;Michael Jackson: Rest in Peace&quot; for $10 each.  \nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\nAlthough some reports claim Jackson may have overdosed on Demerol, Brian Oxman &#x2013; who has served as the family&apos;s attorney for more than 20 years &#x2013; told Usmagazine.com he couldn&apos;t comment on the types of medications Jackson was taking.\n&quot;It is something which is private to Michael, and we&apos;ll have to wait for the toxicology reports before we jump to any kind of conclusions,&quot; he said. &quot;I only know that I warned that his day may come.

Jackson&apos;s albums and other Jackson-related compilations now hold the top nine positions on Billboard&apos;s Top Pop Catalog chart, all posting remarkable jumps in sales in the days following the singer&apos;s death, according to Nielsen SoundScan, which tracked sales through Sunday.  \nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years.\nThe King of Pop holds a record eight of the top 10 spots. His Number Ones greatest hits package leads the pack at No. 1, selling more than 108,000 copies, a staggering 2,340 percent sales increase.   The Essential Michael Jackson and Thriller take the next two spots, selling more than 102,000 and 101,000 copies, respectively.  Revisit the King of Pop&apos;s most unforgettable moments. Nearly 30 years after its first release, his breakthrough Off the Wall album came in at No. 4. The Jackson 5&apos;s Ultimate Collection is next at No. 5. Also on the list were his Bad, Dangerous and HIStory -- Volume 1 albums and his 2004 box set, The Ultimate Collection, which landed at No. 9.  The only non-Jackson album that was on the Billboard&apos;s top 10 list was a reissue of the Woodstock movie. It came in at No. 10.\nLook back on Michael Jackson&apos;s life.\nJackson&apos;s solo albums sold more than 422,000 copies this past week, according to Nielsen. The week before his death, the same titles sold only 10,000 copies. The one-week total is also nearly 40 percent more than what his catalog had sold in all of 2009.  The late singer also broke the record for digital downloads, as 58 percent of his solo albums were attained this way. He is the first artist to hold six of the top 10 slots on the Digital Albums chart, including the top four spots.

It&apos;s just not healthy.&quot;\r\nGrimes, 18, also responded to critics who said her smoking habit is a bad influence.  &quot;I cant say that im proud of it, but there are so many people struggling with the addiction nowadays,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I started smoking at about 16, and 1 in 5 teenagers smoke.\r\n&quot;I&apos;m not going to really go into the issue, but my hope is that you will all just stop hating and get on with it,&quot; she continued. &quot;I smoke.

A part of me is sad to say goodbye to something that has been such a prominent part of my life, but I know that it was time and I am very happy with my decision. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has watched and supported me over the years.&quot;\nSee what all The Hills stars wore to the 2009 MTV Movie Awards!\n &quot;While putting my personal relationships and struggles on television wasn&apos;t always easy, the support I received from people made such a difference,&quot; Conrad continued. &quot;Because of all of you, I was able to accomplish so many aspirations and for that I am very grateful. So, THANK YOU EVERYONE!!! I have some interesting projects in the works and I will keep you all updated.&quot;  Before signing off, she said, &quot;From what I&apos;ve heard the next season will not disappoint.&quot;  The Hills finale drew 1.23-million female viewers in the 18 to 34 demo -- slightly down from the 1.3 million who tuned in for December&apos;s finale.  Kristin Cavallari has been hired to replace Conrad -- and already she  is stirring up drama.\nLook back at famous Hills scandals\n&quot;We are not really fans of her,&quot; Stephanie Pratt told Usmagazine.com at the MTV Movie Awards. &quot;She doesn&apos;t want to be friends with us. She wants to bring her acting skills to The Hills and yell at all of us.&quot;\nSee what The Hills stars looked like as babies!\nAudrina Patridge also recently said she didn&apos;t &quot;like&quot; Cavallari.  She confirmed the two had a fight the first day of filming bonus episodes of the MTV show (it has been rumored that Cavallari has been pursuing Patridge&apos;s ex, Justin Bobby).\nMeow! Check out reality TV&apos;s biggest catfights of all time\nPatridge was mum on what went down, but told Ryan Seacrest, &quot;When someone gets in my face, I have to defend myself. And, you guys, I mean, I can&apos;t say much. They&apos;ll show it, but I mean, all I have to say is, it&apos;s really pathetic and desperate what people will do when the cameras are around.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id":

Though she continues to run her $30 million-a-year ClubJenna empire, the 33-year-old is focusing on a Hollywood biopic, a comic book and a clothing line, due out next year.    Nearly two weeks after the three-hour surgery that took the 5-foot-6 star from a D-cup to a C-up, she sat down with Us Weekly to discuss her new body, her boyfriend (ultimate fighter Tito Ortiz, 33) and the future.    \r\nOn why she had her implants removed: &quot;When I had implants, I felt uncomfortable. I would be shy at the beach. I know it sounds funny, but I&apos;d wear high-necked clothes -- unless I was at an adult-film convention. So I thought, Why don&apos;t I be who I am and get my real ones back?&quot;\r\nOn how removing the implants changed her: &quot;Even for women with naturally large boobs, getting a reduction is so freeing. I feel like I can stand up straighter. Before, when I jogged, I had to hold my boobs. I looked like I was molesting myself!&quot;\r\nOn how she felt postsurgery: &quot;Ecstatic. The first thing I did when I got home was open my bra. I wasn&apos;t supposed to but I did. I was so happy, I cried. It was like looking into the mirror when I was 17.&quot;\r\nOn whether she&apos;s done with porn forever: &quot;Yes. A hundred percent.&quot;\r\nOn who will play her in a movie about her life: &quot;I would love Scarlett Johansson to play me. I think Rachel McAdams is amazing, and Sienna Miller.&quot;\r\nOn celebrating her one-year anniversary with boyfriend Tito:  &quot;I had my surgery while he was in Iraq on a USO tour. He was so excited: &apos;I&apos;m coming home to brand new boobies.&apos;&quot;\r\nFor more details on Jenna&apos;s dramatic surgery and how she keeps the rest of her body in shape, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands this week.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jenna-jameson-why-i-removed-my-breast-implants-2007228/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jenna Jameson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jenna-jameson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rachel McAdams", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/rachel-mcadams/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Scarlett Johansson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/scarlett-johansson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sienna Miller", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/sienna-miller/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jenna-jameson-why-i-removed-my-breast-implants-2007228/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jenna-jameson-why-i-removed-my-breast-implants-2007228/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jenna Jameson: Why I Removed My Breast Implants", "datePublished": "2007-08-22T14:35:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:18+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jenna-jameson-why-i-removed-my-breast-implants-2007228/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 382, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jenna-jameson-why-i-removed-my-breast-implants-2007228/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jenna-jameson-why-i-removed-my-breast-implants-2007228/#respond"]}], "description": "Adult film star Jenna Jameson has decided to retire from adult filmmaking, and that's not all she's left behind.

On June 30, he released a statement through his lawyer stating he was &quot;aware of media reports&quot; about the paternity but &quot;because of patient confidentiality, Dr. Klein will make no statement on any reports or allegations.&quot;\r\nUs Weekly has confirmed from multiple sources that Klein is Prince and Paris&apos; biological father. Debbie Rowe, who worked for Klein for 23 years, is the biological mother. In the new issue of Us Weekly, Klein&apos;s longtime partner Stephen Price says that the kids called Klein &quot;Uncle Arnold,&quot; and came along with Price as a guest to the Jackson house last Christmas.\r\nSee photos Jackson and his kids through the years.\r\nThe new issue also includes a 2003 interview with Debbie Rowe where she told Us Weekly&apos;s Ian Drew about her decision to carry Jackson&apos;s babies, &quot;[Michael] said no at first. I had to nag him into it if you will. I really wanted to do it for him.&quot;\r\nLook back at Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments.\r\nIn the GMA interview, Klein spoke warmly of the children (Jackson also raised Blanket, 7), calling them &quot;brilliant&quot; and reminiscing about their last Christmas with their father. (The new issue of Us Weekly has exclusive photos from the gathering, which also included Star Wars icon Carrie Fisher.)\r\n&quot;The kids were so very happy and so beautiful,&quot; Klein said. &quot;Every time they would pass their father they would say, &apos;I love you Daddy.&apos;&quot;\r\nKlein last saw Jackson June 22 &#x2013; three days before he died of cardiac arrest.\r\n&quot;He was not in terrible pain when I saw him. He danced in the office, and he danced for my patients,&quot; Klein said. &quot;He was very muscular, and he was very, very happy and dancing.\r\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years.\r\n&quot;I saw nothing at that point that would make me worry whatsoever,&quot; he continued. &quot;But I was always concerned about him because I was always worried about other doctors.&quot;\r\nKlein also denied that he is under investigation for supplying Jackson with any prescription narcotics.\r\n&quot;I say that anyone who makes someone an addict or gives a person potentially dangerous substances directly to them to use, like [anesthesia] propofol is a criminal,&quot; Klein told Good Morning America. &quot;It becomes nothing more than a manslaughter, or something worse than that.\r\nSee 32 photos from Jackson&apos;s Staples Center memorial.\r\n&quot;There was nothing wrong with the manner I treated Michael, because what I had to do is restructure for an individual who had lupus, who had terrible acne scarring his face,&quot; Klein added. &quot;But I was not one of the doctors who participated in giving him overdoses of drugs or too much of anything. In fact, I was the one who limited everything, who stopped everything.&quot;\r\nRegardless, Klein said, &quot;no matter what he wanted, someone would give it to him. The very rich and the very poor and the very famous all get the worst medical care.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id":

It was an amazing way to see the city. Now when we travel, we try to explore the places by running.&quot;Her other tip?Ever since she turned 30 this past February, she gives herself positive affirmations.\r\n\r\n&quot;I fall asleep feeling beautiful,&quot; she says. &quot;Then, in the morning, before I leave the house, I say five things I love about myself, like, &apos;You have really pretty eyes.&apos; That way I can go out into the world with that little bit of extra confidence.

He also had strands of his hair hanging in front of his face \u2013 a 'do Jackson famously sported.\r\n\r\nFeldman used a Kleenex to wipe tears from under his sunglasses.\r\n\r\nJohn Mayer gave him a puzzled look.\r\n\r\n\"I've been crying a lot and I'm just drained,\" he told Us after the ceremony. \"Michael changed the world and I think we should remember him for that.\"\r\n\r\nAsked about the funeral, \"It was beautiful. Paris got me the most when she spoke.\"\r\n\r\nFeldman befriended Jackson in the 1980s. The two had a rocky relationship during Feldman's teen years and eventually drifted apart. They didn't talk for several years before Jackson's death.\r\n\r\nAfter Jackson's June 25 death Feldman wrote on his website: \"I am trembling and shaking at the moment and it is very hard to type. I am filled with tremendous sadness and remorse. All I choose to remember from this point is the good times we shared and what an inspiration he was to me and the rest of the world. Nobody will ever be able to do what Michael Jackson has done in this industry, and he was so close to doing it all again. I am truly, and deeply sorry for all of the heartbroken fans and supporters worldwide. I think I am still in shock.

I&apos;m actually pretty good at it,&quot; Aniston, 40, tells Parade magazine.\r\nThe actress -- who earned $25 million in 2008 -- says she &quot;grew up with absolutely no money at all.\r\n&quot;I struggled for a while, but I was happy with my life whether I was making this amount of money, or that amount of money,&quot; she says. &quot;I always enjoyed where I was working.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn addition to cleaning, she held a host of other jobs while waiting for her big break on Friends.\r\n&quot;I loved being a waitress. OK, I didn&apos;t like time-share selling, I hated that job. But people used to say to me, &apos;You need to focus on having ambition,&apos;&quot; she says. &quot;And I guess sort of following that advice allowed a lot to come to me.&quot;\r\nAniston says she&apos;s still the same person today as when she was scrubbing bathrooms.\r\n\r\n&quot;There&apos;s just been a great ease with that evolvement in my life to being an actress. I didn&apos;t change that much, but my bank account changed,&quot; she jokes.\r\nThe actress -- most recently linked to The Bounty costar Gerard Butler -- also opens up about her love life, saying shooting so many romantic comedies &quot;probably [doesn&apos;t] help because one is work and one is life. I certainly try to access my personal life when I&apos;m doing my job.

Anywhere between 10 to 20.  Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I don&apos;t even know what I was taking.&quot;  After a 2005 stint in rehab, he says he relapsed and nearly died from an overdose after ingesting unidentified blue pills an acquaintance had given him.  &quot;My doctor told me those mysterious new pills were methadone, which is used to wean heroin addicts off dope,&quot; he says. &quot;Had I known it was methadone, I probably wouldn&apos;t have taken it. But as bad as I was back then, I can&apos;t even say 100 percent for sure. My doctor told me the amount of methadone I&apos;d taken was equivalent to shooting up four bags of heroin. Even when they told me I almost died, it didn&apos;t click.&quot;\r\nSee photos of famous Hollywood meltdowns\r\nAfter detoxing, he suffered a knee injury that required surgery, but because of his drug abuse, he was not prescribed pain killers.   &quot;I started looking around my house to see if I had a stash box of Vicodin,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m ransacking my house, finally find something in the basement, in a little napkin, seven and a half Vicodin &apos;the big extra strength ones&apos; and a few Valium.&quot;\r\nSee photos of Eminem and other stars at court\r\nAfter relapsing a second time, he finally came to terms with the fact that he is an addict.  &quot;It never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family,&quot; he says. &quot;Now that I understand that I&apos;m an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it.&quot;  Sober for a year, the rapper - who drops his new album, Relapse, May 19, says, &quot;I wanted to make an overall statement: I&apos;m back.  It was a slow process. You gotta remember I hadn&apos;t recorded a song sober in seven years.  So it took me awhile to even feel like I could record a song sober ... I don&apos;t know the last time I shot a video sober, without drinking or taking anything. It&apos;s been years.&quot;\r\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\r\nAdds the rapper, &quot;I almost feel like a little kid again with rap. I wanna play around with different flows. If I don&apos;t feel like it&apos;s what I&apos;m fully capable of, if there&apos;s one weak line, I wanna change it. Rap was my drug.  It used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high. Then I had to resort to other things to make me feel that ... now rap&apos;s getting me high again.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Eminem", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/eminem/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Eminem Opens Up About 20-Pill-a-Day Addiction", "datePublished": "2009-05-04T18:31:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:49+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 524, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#respond"]}], "description": "\"The numbers got so high I don't even know what I was taking,\" he says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/", "name": "Eminem Opens Up About 20-Pill-a-Day Addiction", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-04T18:31:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:49+00:00", "description": "\"The numbers got so high I don't even know what I was taking,\" he says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Eminem vibe b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Eminem Opens Up About 20-Pill-a-Day Addiction"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

In a dark place. I never thought that being with someone else was the answer. I would say, &quot;I&apos;m alone, but I&apos;m not lonely. But I was just kidding myself. Then I started hanging around Emma, and on a day-to-day basis my life became much happier.&quot;  \nSee photos of stars who are better after their breakups.\nNow, he and his wife -- they married on the Turks and Caicos islands in March with Moore and Kutcher as guests -- enjoy vacations  with the whole family in the Caribbean, where the only tension comes from their beach volleyball games.  &quot;I still have a scar on my knee from two Christmases ago,&quot; Emma says.\nAlthough Emma -- who was engaged to Brent Bolthouse in 2005 when the two first met -- has given Willis a new lease on life, he admits that he will always have feelings for his ex-wife of nearly nine years.  &quot;I still love her,&quot; he says. &quot;And I have a lot of respect for how she lives her life.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bruce-willis-on-ashton-demi-weve-become-like-a-tribe-2009156/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Ashton Kutcher", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/ashton-kutcher/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Bruce Willis", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/bruce-willis/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Demi Moore", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/demi-moore/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bruce-willis-on-ashton-demi-weve-become-like-a-tribe-2009156/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bruce-willis-on-ashton-demi-weve-become-like-a-tribe-2009156/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Bruce Willis on Ashton &#038;

Our kids are still my No. 1 priority. I love them and want to make sure they stay happy, healthy and safe.\n&quot;My job is being the best, most supportive and loving father that I can be to my kids, and not being married to Kate doesn&apos;t change that. This will be a difficult transition for all of us, but Kate and I will work out a schedule that enables our kids to have plenty of quality time with both of us at home in Pennsylvania.\n&quot;I am deeply saddened that we are divorcing, and also hurt by the statement Kate made last night about the divorce. I have always done everything I can to protect our family.\nSee how the Gosselins have spent summer\n&quot;The one thing I do agree with in Kate&apos;s statement is her desire to resolve things amicably. Of course emotions are running high for both of us right now, but for the sake of our children and our family&apos;s privacy, I hope that we can both limit our public comments about the legal proceedings going forward.&quot;\nSee what Kate looked like in high school\nBefore ending his statement, Jon said his Father&apos;s Day last weekend was one of his best ones yet because, &quot;I was home with the kids for four days, just being a dad. No nannies, just the kids and me. In fact, with the exception of Aaden&apos;s visit to the doctor, I couldn&apos;t have imagined a better way to spend Fathers Day weekend.&quot;\nIn divorce papers filed Monday - the same day they announced the split to record ratings on their TLC show - Kate said her marriage to Jon is &quot;irretrievably broken.&quot;\nWhile filing for a no-fault divorce in Pennsylvania&apos;s Montgomery County Court, she also said she is willing to &quot;negotiate a fair and reasonable&quot;

It&apos;s two hours drive from Rio and 40 minutes by boat,&quot; he told Us at the Oral B Pulsonic showcase in NYC Sunday.&#xA0;\r\n\r\n&quot;Usually it&apos;s about going to a trainer and all that but [the resort has] a very holistic approach. But I needed to bring my body into fitness -- so I went for nine days,&quot; he says. &quot;It was a total vegetarian diet. Basically, you spend all day doing yoga, hiking, kayaking, eating vegetarian food, no coffee, no alcohol, no meat.&#xA0;\r\n&quot;You&apos;re cleansing yourself, but not starving yourself,&quot; he goes on. &quot;I&apos;ve never been a vegetarian, but the way they prepare it is exquisite. And you&apos;re in one of the most beautiful Atlantic rain forests on the planet.&#xA0;\r\n&quot;I&apos;m not a big yoga person, so that was hard. But it was basic Hatha yoga. I loved it,&quot; he continues. &quot;Also there&apos;s painting there. I wanted to do something that was intense, but had a holistic way, which is this.&quot;\r\nNow he&apos;s struggling to maintain his new body.\r\n&quot;The only problem is the upkeep of it. Restaurant portions are way too big.

LaBeouf -- who once called his mom &quot;the sexiest woman I know&quot; -- admits: &quot;The good actors are all screwed up.\nSee what Shia -- and other stars --  look like as Lego characters!\n&quot;They&apos;re all in pain. It&apos;s a profession of  bottom-feeders and heartbroken people,&quot; he goes on.  The 23-year-old says that when he&apos;s feeling insecure, he stops his bike on the side of a busy road to see if people passing by recognize him (he&apos;s afraid they won&apos;t).  \nCheck out more photos of stars on bikes.\n&quot;Actors live dependent on being validated by other people&apos;s opinions. I don&apos;t understand what it is I do that people want. I don&apos;t know what an actor does. I have no credentials. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing. To my mind, talent doesn&apos;t really exist. Talent is like a card player&apos;s luck. It is motivation, ambition, and luck. It&apos;s just a drive to be the best. I think acting is a con game.&quot;  LaBeouf admits he doesn&apos;t &quot;handle fame well.&quot;\nSee what stars looked like before they were famous.\n&quot;Most actors on most days don&apos;t think they&apos;re worthy,&quot; he goes on. &quot;I have no idea where this insecurity comes from, but it&apos;s a God-sized hole. If I knew, I&apos;d fill it, and I&apos;d be on my way.&quot;  LaBeouf goes on: &quot;Sometimes I feel I&apos;m living a meaningless life and I get frightened. I know I&apos;m one of the luckiest dudes in America right now. I have a great house. My parents don&apos;t have to work. I&apos;ve got money. I&apos;m famous. But it could all change, man. It could go away. You never know.&quot;\nThe actor also opens about his spring 2007 split from first love China Brezner, a producer&apos;s daughter he met on the set of The Greatest Game Ever Played.  \nCheck out more ugly Hollywood splits.\n&quot;Maybe it was career pressure.... Maybe I chose work. Every man has those feelings of escape and survival,&quot; he says.  &quot;I know you shouldn&apos;t be that way. I&apos;m trying to understand it and find the answers. I don&apos;t have them now. Why did the love of my life and I break up Man, I have no idea. What was that all about? I have no answers to anything. None.&quot;\n&quot;Why am I an alcoholic?&quot; the actor, who was arrested for DUI in July 2008 (charges were dropped), goes on. &quot;I haven&apos;t a ---- clue! What is life about? I don&apos;t know.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Shia LaBeouf", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/shia-labeouf/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Shia LaBeouf: I Get My Sense of Humor From Watching Parents &#8220;Have Sex&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-06-10T18:24:11+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:34+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 545, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#respond"]}], "description": "\"The good actors are all screwed up,\" he says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/", "name": "Shia LaBeouf: I Get My Sense of Humor From Watching Parents \"Have Sex\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-10T18:24:11+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:34+00:00", "description": "\"The good actors are all screwed up,\" he says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Shia b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-i-get-my-sense-of-humor-from-watching-parents-have-sex-2009106/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Shia LaBeouf: I Get My Sense of Humor From Watching Parents &#8220;Have Sex&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it.

In 2007, she faced off against RCA honcho Clive Davis over the release of her third album My December. He said the album lacked radio hits; she disagreed and aired her frustrations to the press. (&quot;I am not a fan [of Davis],&quot; she icily told USA Weekend.)  In the end, Clarkson apologized to &quot;those whom I have done disservice&quot; after the release of the album (which failed to go platinum). &quot;I would never intentionally hurt anyone,&quot; she said on her website. &quot;I love music, and I love the people I am blessed to work with.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kelly-clarkson-it-sucks-people-think-i-ripped-off-beyonce-2009277/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/beyonce-knowles/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clive Davis", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/clive-davis/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kelly Clarkson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kelly-clarkson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kelly-clarkson-it-sucks-people-think-i-ripped-off-beyonce-2009277/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kelly-clarkson-it-sucks-people-think-i-ripped-off-beyonce-2009277/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Kelly Clarkson: It &#8220;Sucks&#8221;

As Us Weekly first reported last week, he even texted her that Harris wasn&apos;t his &quot;type.&quot; (Us also reported that he  slept with Johnson a week after proposing to Harris and tried to bed another woman, Bethany Steffen, a few days later.)\nSee photos of Jillian Harris through the years\nOn April 12, three days before he told Harris he had to leave the show to focus on his career,

The couple is due in court on July 15.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Tameka Foster Raymond", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/tameka-foster-raymond/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Usher", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/usher/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Usher Speaks Out After Divorce", "datePublished": "2009-06-18T15:52:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:30+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 349, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity Moms"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#respond"]}], "description": "\"Having an incredible team\" is helping him manage \"any turmoil,\" he says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/", "name": "Usher Speaks Out After Divorce", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-18T15:52:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:30+00:00", "description": "\"Having an incredible team\" is helping him manage \"any turmoil,\" he says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Usher arrives at the LA's Best Annual Brunch on June 7, 2009 in Los Angeles, California", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/usher-speaks-out-after-divorce-2009186/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Usher Speaks Out After Divorce"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

She&apos;s definitely the heart of the panel.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;The kind of heart she treated the contestants with she treated me with last year,&quot; said DioGuardi, who added that she was &quot;scared&quot; joining the show last season. &quot;She was so kind to me and made me feel immediately like part of the panel.&quot;\r\nDioGuardi added that she hopes Abdul &quot;will reconsider&quot; her decision to leave.\r\n\r\n&quot;I&apos;ve left her a lot of messages. I talked to her last week,&quot; DioGuardi said. &quot;I haven&apos;t spoken to her this week.&quot;  DioGuardi shot down speculation that she was hired last season as an insurance policy against Abdul in case she leaves.\r\n\r\n&quot;The way I&apos;m understanding it is that it was her choice to leave,&quot; DioGuardi said of Abdul. &quot;I never was here to replace her. It would be impossible to replace Paula Abdul. She&apos;s an incredible talent. She is somebody who helped make the show as big as it is. How could you ever replace that?&quot;\r\n&quot;If anything, she was really somebody who helped me because it was awkward at times being the fourth person,&quot; she added.  \r\n\r\nDioGuardi - who is in Denver Friday to begin auditions - said she is excited to return to the show alongside Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson for a second season, calling Idol &quot;an incredible show.&quot;  Said the new judge, &quot;Last year, it was tough at times.\r\nBeing the new kid, you get beat up a bit. I&apos;m hoping this year that people are more accepting.&quot;   On Thursday, Fox Entertainment Chairman Peter Rice said producers are currently looking for a fourth judge to replace Abdul. (Katy Perry and Victoria Beckham are among the guest judges who have signed on.)\r\n\r\nAbdul - who left show because she reportedly she didn&apos;t get her desired $20 million deal - isn&apos;t sweating the fact that she is out of a job.  &quot;At this point, there are so many wonderful things that are being offered to me,&quot; Abdul told the Associated Press Thursday. &quot;And I got to take a deep breath, sleep a little ... and go through everything.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id":

County Coroner tells Usmagazine.com.  &quot;We are serving a Coroner subpoena at the office of Dr. Klein to obtain medical records,&quot; Craig Harvey, Los Angeles County&apos;s chief coroner investigator, tells Usmagazine.com. &quot;That is all I can comment on.&quot;\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments.\nAs for reports that Klein is under investigation, Harvey tells Us: &quot;We do not investigate physicians, so I cannot comment on that. We routinely serve coroner subpoenas on physicians and hospitals and have served several in connection with this case.  I cannot comment on who we have served subpoenas on or what records we have received or not.&quot;  Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter tells Us: &quot;We are continuing our investigation on the death of Michael Jackson. There are rumors that Dr. Klein is not cooperating, that is not true. We are still conducting an investigation and there is a security hold on the case and I can&apos;t comment any further.&quot;  An attorney for Klein, Bradley Boyer, tells Us: &quot;Dr. Klein has been and continues to cooperate with the coroners office into the investigation if the death of Michael Jackson. There will be no further comments in Dr. Klein at this time. Also the coroner has indicated to us that Dr. Klein is not under investigation by the coroners office.&quot;  Klein denied he was being examined by authorities for supplying Jackson with prescription narcotics during a July 8 appearance on Good Morning America. (The singer was reportedly using powerful sedative Diprivan &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201D; generic name: propofol --  at the time of his June 25 death from cardiac arrest.)   \nSee photos of Michael Jackson and his kids.\n&quot;I say that anyone who makes someone an addict or gives a person potentially dangerous substances directly to them to use, like [anesthesia] propofol is a criminal,&quot; Klein told GMA. &quot;It becomes nothing more than a manslaughter, or something worse than that.\nSee 32 photos from inside Michael Jackson&apos;s memorial.\n&quot;There was nothing wrong with the manner I treated Michael, because what I had to do is restructure for an individual who had lupus, who had terrible acne scarring his face,&quot; Klein added. &quot;But I was not one of the doctors who participated in giving him overdoses of drugs or too much of anything. In fact, I was the one who limited everything, who stopped everything.&quot;  Toxicology reports that may determine the cause of Jackson&apos;s death could be completed within the next few weeks Assistant Chief Coroner Winter said Monday.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Dermatologist Subpoenaed for Michael Jackson Medical Records", "datePublished": "2009-07-14T19:57:37+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:47+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 480, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity Moms"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#respond"]}], "description": "Coroner confiscates the singer's medical documents at Dr. Arnold Klein's Beverly Hills office"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/", "name": "Dermatologist Subpoenaed for Michael Jackson Medical Records", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-14T19:57:37+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:47+00:00", "description": "Coroner confiscates the singer's medical documents at Dr. Arnold Klein's Beverly Hills office", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Klein jackson b_0", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/dermatologist-subpoenaed-for-michael-jackson-medical-records-2009147/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Dermatologist Subpoenaed for Michael Jackson Medical Records"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

It was an unusual relationship, yes, where two unusual people who did not live or know a &apos;Normal life&apos; found a connection, perhaps with some suspect timing on his part. Nonetheless, I do believe he loved me as much as he could love anyone and I loved him very much.....\n&quot;I wanted to &apos;save him&apos; I wanted to save him from the inevitable, which is what has just happened.....\n&quot;His family and his loved ones also wanted to save him from this as well but didn&apos;t know how and this was 14 years ago. We all worried that this would be the outcome then.....\n&quot;At that time, In trying to save him, I almost lost myself. ....\n&quot;He was an incredibly dynamic force and power that was not to be underestimated.....  &quot;When he used it for something good, It was the best and when he used it for something bad, It was really, REALLY bad.....\nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\n&quot;Mediocrity was not a concept that would even for a second enter Michael Jackson&apos;s being or actions.....\n&quot;I became very ill and emotionally/spiritually exhausted in my quest to save him from certain self-destructive behavior and from the awful vampires and leeches he would always manage to magnetize around him.  ....\n&quot;I was in over my head while trying.....\n&quot;I had my children to care for, I had to make a decision.....  &quot;The hardest decision I have ever had to make, which was to walk away and let his fate have him, even though I desperately loved him and tried to stop or reverse it somehow.....\n&quot;After the Divorce, I spent a few years obsessing about him and what I could have done different, in regret.....  &quot;Then I spent some angry years at the whole situation.....  &quot;At some point, I truly became Indifferent, until now.....\n&quot;As I sit here overwhelmed with sadness, reflection and confusion at what was my biggest failure to date, watching on the news almost play by play The exact Scenario I saw happen on August 16th, 1977 happening again right now with Michael (A sight I never wanted to see again) just as he predicted, I am truly, truly gutted.....  &quot;Any ill experience or words I have felt towards him in the past has just died inside of me along with him.....\nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories\n&quot;He was an amazing person and I am lucky to have gotten as close to him as I did and to have had the many experiences and years that we had together.....  &quot;I desperately hope that he can be relieved from his pain, pressure and turmoil now.....\n&quot;He deserves to be free from all of that and I hope he is in a better place or will be.....  &quot;I also hope that anyone else who feels they have failed to help him can be set free because he hopefully finally is.....\n&quot;The World is in shock but somehow he knew exactly how his fate would be played out some day more than anyone else knew, and he was right.....  &quot;I really needed to say this right now, thanks for listening.....&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lisa-marie-presley-michael-jackson-knew-he-would-die-young-2009266/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Lisa Marie Presley", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/lisa-marie-presley/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lisa-marie-presley-michael-jackson-knew-he-would-die-young-2009266/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lisa-marie-presley-michael-jackson-knew-he-would-die-young-2009266/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Lisa Marie Presley: Michael Jackson &#8220;Knew&#8221;

After undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments, she was declared cancer free by her doctors on Feb. 2, 2007 -- her 60th birthday. But the cancer returned a few months later, spreading to other parts of her body, including her liver.  &quot;It&apos;s insidious, cancer,&quot; O&apos;Neal tells Vieira in the interview, airing Wednesday and Thursday on the Today show. &quot;It lets you think you&apos;re ahead.&quot;  Fawcett thought she was ahead &quot;for a couple of years,&quot; O&apos;Neal said. &quot;She was athletic and healthy and hungry and beautiful. Everything was just as you remember about her.&quot;\nSee stars who have beat cancer\n But he realized for the first time that she wasn&apos;t well &quot;five or six months ago&quot; -- when their troubled son Redmond &quot;wasn&apos;t in jail,&quot; he notes -- while the three of them were walking on the beach.  &quot;We used to take that walk all the time to the rocks and back,&quot; O&apos;Neal says. &quot;And halfway there she stopped and said, &apos;Can we go back?&apos; And Red and I looked at each other and we knew.&quot;\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\nAfter being by Fawcett&apos;s side through it all, O&apos;Neal says he can&apos;t describe his love for her.   &quot;I know this, that in the last two years I loved her more than I&apos;ve ever loved her - ever,&quot; he says. &quot;She&apos;s so much more of a woman ... powerful, courageous, fearless and all those adjectives. And I look at her with awe.&quot;\nSee Hollywood&apos;s most romantic couples\n&quot;And she&apos;s not afraid, either,&quot; O&apos;Neal continues. &quot;I never saw fear at all.  She asked me once: Am I gonna make it? She asked me that a couple of weeks ago.&quot;  &quot;I said, &apos;Yeah, sure, you&apos;ll make it. And if you don&apos;t, I&apos;ll go with you,&apos;&quot; says O&apos;Neal. &quot;And she said, &apos;Then stop the Gleevec.&apos; And the Gleevec&apos;s the medicine that I take for my leukemia. So she made a joke.&quot;  Although those close to the couple call O&apos;Neal &quot;the rock,&quot; the actor says, &quot;She&apos;s the rock. She taught us all how to cope. She&apos;s extraordinary. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll do without her, to tell you the truth.&quot;  On Monday, Fawcett&apos;s rep downplayed stories about the actress&apos; illness after O&apos;Neal remarked last week that her treatment &quot;has pretty much ended.&quot; The rep told Usmagazine.com, &quot;She never stopped getting treatment.&quot;\nA family source told Us Monday that doctors in Germany -- where Fawcett was treated earlier this year -- are now developing alternative medicines for the actress.  Interviewed by Vieira, Fawcett&apos;s pal Alana Stewart said the treatments are &quot;very traditional.&quot;  &quot;They go in through your main artery and they go into the organ and they inject chemo directly into the tumor or tumor,&quot; she explained. &quot;You know, into the organ.

The source adds that show creator Shonda Rhimes had until June 30 to decide Knight&apos;s fate, but the actor ended up asking the network himself to be let go early.\r\n&quot;He&apos;s had enough of Shonda and ABC,&quot; says the source. &quot;He decided to take back his power.&quot;   \r\n\r\nIn the May season finale, Knight&apos;s character Dr. George O&apos;Malley appeared to have died after he was struck by a bus. (The fate of Heigl&apos;s character Izzie also looked grim, as she lost consciousness following her cancer battle. It remains to be seen if she will return to the show in the fall.)\r\nBoth reps for Knight and ABC have no comment.\r\nSo what&apos;s next for Knight?\r\nGet the latest T.R.

But her smooth, long bangs just do not match with the short, spiky back.&quot;  Joseph adds that the look is &quot;definitely not appropriate for a woman of that age.&quot; (Gosselin is 34.)\r\n\r\n Joseph jokingly calls the look &quot;the modernized version of the mullet -- business in the front, party in the back.&quot;\r\n\r\nMatthew James Fugate of NYC&apos;s Sam Brocato Salon tells Us there is a plus side to Gosselin&apos;s &apos;do: It won&apos;t take long to style.\r\n&quot;Hold your super long bangs in your hand,&quot;

Get your act together.&quot;\r\nSee photos of today&apos;s top celeb news stories.\r\nFawcett&apos;s son was in court for violating probation on a 2008 DUI and drug possession conviction. Instead of sentencing him to jail, Millington ordered O&apos;Neal to remain in custody until April 30, when he will be sentenced. According to Shiara Davila-Morales, a spokeswoman for the L.A. County District Attorney&apos;s office, he will most likely enter the in-custody drug treatment program during this time.

(The two women both have long dark hair, full lips and a love for a large brood of children.)  &quot;I have never even thought of Angelina Jolie, except the last time I saw a movie,&quot; Suleman, 33, told Ann Curry. &quot;I think that was like years ago. This is so far away from the place I&apos;m in right now, to think of any celebrity.&quot;  \nCheck out photos of Angelina Jolie&apos;s six kids!\nSuleman denied having plastic surgery. When Curry asked her if she had her lips done, Suleman replied, &quot;No, no.&quot;\nCheck out all the places Angelina Jolie has visited across the world!\nSuleman also said she is done having babies after going through six in vitro fertilizations that resulted in four single-births, one set of twins and the octuplets.    \nSee 8 photos of the newborn octuplets!\n&quot;A hundred percent. Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred percent,&quot; she said. &quot;Yes. I&apos;m done.  &quot;This is a message, I believe, from God that you are done,&quot; the Southern California mother went on. &quot;I never in my wildest dreams imagined [my family] being this big.&quot;  \nWatch a video of Nadya Suleman&apos;s eight new babies!\nBut she said she doesn&apos;t regret deciding to have the eight children.  &quot;I believe all children are our blessings from God and to allocate that role to a doctor, to dispose of a life, is incomprehensible to me,&quot; said Suleman, who is divorced, unemployed and lives with her parents.  Suleman - who is receiving food stamps - said she intends to pay for her children&apos;s needs by finishing her master&apos;s degree in counseling.\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\nShe said that will take a year or two, and in the meantime she plans to use student loans.

She was a selfless person who loved her family and friends with all her heart, and what a big heart it was. Farrah showed immense courage and grace throughout her illness and was an inspiration to those around her.

On her divorce, Witherspoon, 32, says it was &quot;very humiliating and very isolating. But, by the way, if it&apos;s not painful, maybe it wasn&apos;t the right decision to marry to begin with. Those are the appropriate emotions.&quot;  &quot;When people get in your face and say, &apos;This will pass,&apos; you think, Are they crazy?&quot; Witherspoon goes on. &quot;I&apos;m never gonna feel any better than I feel right this minute and nothing&apos;s ever gonna make sense again. And I still have moments where I&apos;m like, Nothing&apos;s ever gonna make sense again.&quot;   \nSee photos of Hollywood&apos;s ugliest divorces\nThe actress -- who has two children, Ava, 8, and Deacon, 4, with Phillippe -- says she tried to avoid the &quot;blame game&quot; with her ex.  &quot;It&apos;s a really easy thing to do, and I&apos;m certainly guilty of it,&quot; she admits. &quot;[You have to] look at yourself and go, &apos;What part of this do I need to own? Which part of this is my responsibility? And that&apos;s the painful work that you have to go through to hopefully get some real life knowledge out of it.&quot;\n See then-and-now photos of Reese and your favorite romantic comedy stars\nShe is now dating Gyllenhaal, whom she met on the set of their 2007 drama, Rendition.  &quot;He&apos;s fabulous. He really is a fantastic guy,&quot; says the star, who voices a toon in the animated flick Monsters vs. Aliens (out March 27). &quot;Unfortunately, he&apos;s not in the movie, so we can&apos;t really talk about him.&quot;   \nSee photos of Reese and Jake and other stars partying at post-Oscar bashes\nShe also opens up about her reported Type A personality.  &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;m a control freak,&quot; she says. &quot;I think I&apos;m just fearful. I operate from a lot of fear, like, of things being lost or forgotten or neglected. Losing the spiritual rather than the physical.&quot;   \nSee what a body language expert has to say about Reese and Jake &quot;It&apos;s so funny to me that somehow I&apos;ve been portrayed as a very, like, closed-off or uptight person,&quot; she adds. &quot;I&apos;m very open.&quot;  She&apos;s especially open when it comes to food.  &quot;I&apos;m made of cookies after the holidays,&quot; says Witherspoon, who denies she is diet obsessed. &quot;Everything inside me is made of sugar and flour and a little red wine - a lot of red wine.&quot;  Witherspoon also says she had gotten used to being a mother -- but it hasn&apos;t  always been easy.  &quot;When I first had Ava, I couldn&apos;t afford [help]. And it was so hard,&quot; she says. &quot;I was out in Los Angeles, living [away from my family]. I really didn&apos;t have any friends. And I had a baby. No one else who was 22 had a baby.

He was 57.\r\n&quot;Patrick Swayze passed away peacefully today with family at his side after facing the challenges of his illness for the last 20 months,&quot; his publicist, Annett Wolf, said in a statement. No other details were given.\r\nThe actor was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January 2008 and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments ever since.\r\nSwayze -- who once said, &quot;I dream of a future with a long, healthy life, a life not lived in the shadow of cancer but in the light&quot; -- made a point to tell fans that even throughout his battle with the disease, his life was filled with positive moments.\r\n\r\n&quot;I am one of the lucky ones with pancreatic cancer that is responding well to the treatment,&quot; he said in a statement in March, at the same time some reports claimed he only had weeks to live. &quot;There is a brand new, 12-week old, Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy named Kumasai in my life who is gorgeous and already showing that he will be one special dog... I have so much to be thankful for at this time.&quot;\r\nIn April, his Ghost costar, Whoopi Goldberg told Us that he was &quot;doing the best he can.&quot;\r\n&quot;He&apos;s kicking butt,&quot; she said. &quot;And, you know, he&apos;s sick. And he, like the rest of us, doesn&apos;t know when it&apos;s going to happen -- because it will happen, that he is going to go -- but he doesn&apos;t know when or where.&quot;\r\nShe added: &quot;His attitude is, &apos;Why wait for it to happen?&apos; So he&apos;s busy as hell.&quot;\r\nIn his first television interview since his diagnosis, the star spoke to Barbara Walters for her ABC special, Patrick Swayze: The Truth in December.\r\n&quot;I&apos;d say five years is pretty wishful thinking,&quot; he had said. &quot;Two years seems likely if you&apos;re going to believe statistics.&quot;\r\nHe told Walters that he was waging his battle against cancer &quot;moment to moment.&quot;\r\nThe actor added: &quot;When do you decide the fight isn&apos;t matching up to your quality of life? So far, I&apos;ve got potential for a lot of quality of life.&quot;\r\nSwayze was born on Aug. 18, 1952, in Houston, Texas. His mother Patsy, a choreographer and dance instructor, inspired him from a young age to pursue ice skating, classical ballet and dancing before he moved to NYC in 1972 to complete his formal dance training.\r\nThe actor&apos;s breakout role was in the 1983 ensemble movie, The Outsiders, but he was best known for his role as Johnny Castle in 1987&apos;s Dirty Dancing, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.\r\nHe was also nominated for Golden Globes for his role in 1990&apos;s Ghost opposite Demi Moore and for 1995&apos;s To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.\r\nHis career also included performances in such films as Red Dawn, Point Break and Donnie Darko. His last role was in A&amp;E series The Beast.\r\nIn January, the star announced that he would write a memoir with his wife Lisa Niemi and was in the process of meeting with publishers.\r\n&quot;I am starting work on my new book, in addition to enjoying the fantastic response from everyone on my A&amp;E series,&quot; he said in March.\r\nSwayze has been married to Niemi since 1975.

There&apos;s truth. There&apos;s peace. What tomorrow will bring is still in question. There is a joy that&apos;s earned by failure or triumph. All those things add up to teach us, if we are open to it.&quot;She also sheds light on her relationship with her estranged mother, Jaid.\r\n\r\n&quot;I believe she will see the film,&quot; she tells Parade, referring to her directorial debut, Whip It. The dramedy, starring Ellen Page, centers on a girl&apos;s rocky relationship with her mother.&quot;I believe she does feel pride in me,&quot; Barrymore says of her mother, to whom she became legally emancipated from in 1991.&quot;I used to pull a lot emotionally from all the stuff with my family, but I did not do this movie to cleanse myself of the mother-daughter debacle that happened in my life,&quot; she continues. &quot;I have been much more objective about my childhood and my relationship with my mother in these last few years. I used to be more attached to all that. I won&apos;t deny that the baggage was there at one point.&quot;Learning to let go of that emotional baggage has made her feel like more of an adult.&quot;I&apos;ve always wondered what it felt like to be an adult, because I&apos;ve always had to mother myself,&quot; she says. &quot;I think maybe I finally am one.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1253814025_drew-justin-290.jpg?w=290&h=387&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 387}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Drew Barrymore", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/drew-barrymore/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Justin Long", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/justin-long/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Drew Barrymore: &#8220;Sexual Love Is Secondary to Me&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-09-24T18:17:12+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-10-29T17:08:18+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 430, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1253814025_drew-justin-290.jpg?w=290&h=387&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#respond"]}], "description": "She says she has \"stopped believing in happy endings\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/", "name": "Drew Barrymore: \"Sexual Love Is Secondary to Me\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1253814025_drew-justin-290.jpg?w=290&h=387&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-09-24T18:17:12+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-10-29T17:08:18+00:00", "description": "She says she has \"stopped believing in happy endings\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1253814025_drew-justin-290.jpg?w=290&h=387&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1253814025_drew-justin-290.jpg?w=290&h=387&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 387, "caption": "1253814025_drew justin 290"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drew-barrymore-sexual-love-is-secondary-to-me-2009249/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Drew Barrymore: &#8220;Sexual Love Is Secondary to Me&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

So I won&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t miss Grissom. And I hope that the audience won&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t miss him either.&quot;\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos.\nWhat will he miss?  &quot;Hair fibers,&quot; says Petersen. &quot;I used to bitch about it a lot the first few years, but I became very adept at having the camera see the fiber, and using the tweezers to pick the fiber up, and then having the camera follow the tweezers to my face so the audience can say, &apos;Oh, Grissom sees it. He knows what it is.&apos; I&apos;ll miss that.&quot;  \nSee then and now photos of your favorite TV stars.\nHis costars aren&apos;t handling his exit so well.  &quot;It was traumatic,&quot; Marg Helgenberger says of his final show, which taped last October. &quot;I couldn&apos;t stop crying. It was hard. I&apos;m having a hard time now, because, you know, we had a great nine years together. It&apos;s just over. It&apos;s the end of an era.&quot;  But Petersen insists he had to go.  &quot;The reason I&apos;m leaving is because I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m becoming too comfortable,&quot; says Petersen. &quot;It&apos;s CSI &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201D; they pay me a lot of money, and I don&apos;t have to work very hard anymore.  &quot;I didn&apos;t want to be on the show because they were paying me money and I liked the money,&quot; says the star, who earned more than $500,000 an episode. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to be on the show because it saved me from having to go look for other jobs. Just didn&apos;t want it. It was too safe for me at this point. So I needed to try and break that, and the way to do that, for me, is the theater.&quot;  Petersen, a theater actor who lives in Chicago, now plays to audiences of only 300 people.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "CSI&#8216;s William Petersen: &#8220;I Won&#8217;t Miss Grissom&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-01-08T18:48:13+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:33+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 446, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#respond"]}], "description": "With his final show airing Jan. 15, he explains why he hopes fans won't miss his famous character either"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/", "name": "CSI's William Petersen: \"I Won't Miss Grissom\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-01-08T18:48:13+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:33+00:00", "description": "With his final show airing Jan. 15, he explains why he hopes fans won't miss his famous character either", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "William Petersen attends the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 21, 2008 in Los Angeles, California.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/csi-william-petersen-i-wont-miss-grissom-200981/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "CSI&#8216;s William Petersen: &#8220;I Won&#8217;t Miss Grissom&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Since May 2008, Kate has made 50 public appearances, criss-crossing the country, often with Neild by her side, as Jon stayed home with the kids. Even when at home -- whether at Starbucks or at restaurants -- Neild has been a constant companion to Gosselin, who is estranged from her family and viewed in town as not having friends.  &quot;He threatened to hire a private investigator,&quot; a family source informed by Jon Gosselin tells Us.\nLook back at photos of Jon and Kate through the years.\nThe married Neild -- who once worked for Bill Clinton, and is often photographed not wearing his wedding band -- were &quot;very physical, often touching each other,&quot; says an employee at a recent promotional appearance for their TLC reality show. &quot;She was gently poking him, giving him little love pats, totally unlike the slapping she does with Jon. She and Steve were joking around so much, I actually wondered if they were having an affair. There&apos;s a lot of open affection between them.&quot; The employee adds Kate showed no affection at all to Jon at the same event.\nCheck out celebs caught cheating\n(Neild&apos;s wife Gina, a one-time close friend of Kate&apos;s, tells Us local and online talk of an affair is &quot;ridiculous&quot;; Kate has confessed she and Jon might split in the same interview she says she is &quot;horrified&quot; by any allegations suggesting she and Neild are romantically involved; TLC refused comment.)  Meanwhile, Us has learned that Jon has had more public trysts with 23-year-old third grade teacher Deanna Hummel than first reported.\nSee photos of the most controversial reality stars of all time\nThe new Us Weekly confirms a mid-March date at the local Ruby Tuesday&apos;s that a waitress describes as &quot;romantic and lovey-dovey.&quot; And on March 28, Hummel and a girlfriend attended Spring Gruv with Jon in Utah while Kate was away. On April 17 -- the day before Jon and Hummel were photographed at 2 a.m. leaving a club -- the two were caught on cell phone camera and were &quot;all over each other&quot; while watching band Dirty Penny perform at Paolo&apos;s Restaurant &amp; Bar in Reading, Pa., a witness tells Us.  \nSee photos of Jon Gosselin and his mistress\nSo what&apos;s next for the couple of nearly 10 years?  A neighbor says he sleeps in an apartment above the garage in the Gosselins&apos; new $1.1 million home.  &quot;Jon says it&apos;s over,&quot; says a family source. &quot;Kate doesn&apos;t want to work on it, he doesn&apos;t want to work on it.&quot;  \nLook back at Hollywood&apos;s most expensive divorces\nFor much more on Kate and her bodyguard&apos;s &quot;inseparable&quot; relationship, what people in her town say she&apos;s really like as a mom, how much money is at stake for the Gosselins, and how Jon is handling the pressure, pick up the newest issue of Us Weekly, on stands

In addition to raking in the big bucks -- Miley Cyrus earned $3.5 million last year -- these young ladies tell Us they keep their heads on straight.\r\nSays honoree Amanda Bynes, 21: &quot;I don&apos;t like to drink.  I have definitely stayed out of the party scene. I&apos;ve been offered to go to those parties, but I feel like I would be the one who would die if I did something.&quot;\r\nOf today&apos;s out of control club-goers, she adds, &quot;I don&apos;t know how they think they&apos;re gonna live forever.&quot;\r\nEchoes High School Musical star Ashley Tisdale, 22: &quot;I don&apos;t drink, and I don&apos;t smoke. It&apos;s a personal preference. My mom has never drunk or smoked. I look up to my mom.&quot;\r\nShe tells Us she doesn&apos;t get how her Hollywood counterparts can find time for clubbing.\r\n&quot;I don&apos;t understand how people do it -- I work non-stop! Then when I&apos;m done working, I&apos;m just so tired I just want to be home,&quot; she says.\r\n&quot;Clubs are just not where I want to be photographed,&quot; adds country singer Taylor Swift, 18.\r\nShe also says she realizes the impact her actions could have on her younger fans.\r\n&quot;For everything I do, I think about a 6-year-old girl and her mom that I saw at my concert last night,&quot; she tells Us. &quot;I think about what those two individuals would think if I were at a club last night. I never want to be arrested, and I never want to get a DUI,&quot; Swift says. &quot;Those are my moral values. I am an over-achiever, and I want to be known for the good things in my life.&quot;\r\nChildhood star-turned-teen queen Raven-Symone obeys a rule: &quot;I like to be in by 1 or 2 a.m.  because [you can get in more trouble] at night. Anytime really, but the night scares me sometimes.&quot;\r\nMiley Cyrus, 15 -- Hollywood&apos;s No. 1. power girl -- offered this tip to today&apos;s troubled young stars.\r\n&quot;The most important thing is really staying true to yourself,&quot; she tells Us. &quot;That&apos;s what my mom taught me. She&apos;s the most beautiful girl, not only on the outside but on the inside.

Legal proceedings to dissolve their marriage began Monday.\n&quot;Kate and I have decided to separate,&quot; a candid Jon announced, calling Monday&apos;s episode his &quot;hardest&quot; show ever. &quot;It&apos;s just not good for us to be arguing in front of our kids. ... We can&apos;t be cordial with one another.&quot;  \nSee the Gosselin family through the years\nWhile Kate said she is &quot;not fond of the idea,&quot; she knows it is &quot;necessary.&quot;  She said she will remain at their $1.1 million home in Wernersville, Pa., and &quot;Jon will also come here when it is his days, and we will flip-flop that way.&quot;  \nSee how the Gosselins have spent summer\nThough she said this is not what she wants for their kids, &quot;My goal is peace.&quot;\nWith tears in her eyes, she added, &quot;If peace needs to be brought about by this, then I&apos;m in agreement.&quot;\nJon called the split &quot;a shame,&quot; adding, &quot;I will always love her as the mother of my kids.&quot;\nSee what Kate Gosselin looked like in high school\n&quot;We&apos;re not running away from them,&quot; he said of their kids. &quot;We&apos;re just living our separate lives and coming back and being with them.&quot;\nKate said she is trying to stay positive.  &quot;There&apos;s a lot of happiness in the past,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope that happiness continues. ... You can find happiness if you look hard enough in any situation.&quot;\nAs for the future of the show, they will continue to interview separately, as they have done so far this season.\nJon - who has been eyeing apartments in New York City - said he doesn&apos;t know if he&apos;ll remain on the show, as he could get a new job. (&quot;I&apos;m only 32 years old,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen.&quot; He also said he is &quot;excited&quot; about starting a new chapter in his life.)\nBut Kate said, &quot;The show must go on. I will continue to be here, be with the kids, do the same things I&apos;ve always done with them.&quot;  Kate said what &quot;worries&quot; her the most about their split is living with &quot;the label that we failed -- how that will affect our kids; how they&apos;ll be another statistic; how they&apos;ll say, &apos;My parents split up when I was fill-in-the-blank age.&apos;&quot;\n&quot;I don&apos;t want to be alone,&quot; Kate added of raising 8-year-old twins, Madelyn and Cara, and 5-year-old sextuplets, Aaden, Joel, Collin, Hannah, Leah and Alexis. &quot;But it&apos;s required and I&apos;ve got to do it.&quot;\nThe two didn&apos;t discuss specific details about Jon&apos;s wild nights with 23-year-old school teach Deanna Hummel, but he did admit: &quot;It&apos;s been a hard seven to eight months. It&apos;s been a harder four months.&quot;  \nSee more controversial photos of Jon and 23-year-old girlfriend Deanna Hummel\nA big issue for the couple: Jon said he was always &quot;too passive&quot; during his marriage to Kate. &quot;I just let her rule the roost and do whatever she wanted to do,&quot; he explained. &quot;Now I&apos;ve finally stood up on my own two feet, and I&apos;m proud of myself.&quot;\nTension between the two was palpable at the beginning of Monday&apos;s show as the family installed playhouses from the Kids Crooked House company.  The couple clashed over where the playhouses should go.\nJon cleared land deep in the woods - an area he thought would be safe because the paparazzi wouldn&apos;t be able to photograph the kids.  Kate didn&apos;t object initially, but when she saw where the houses would be located, she got upset.\n&quot;I was concerned that they would never go down there, and if they did, an adult would need to go with them,&quot; she said. &quot;To have an adult walk down there is not always feasible.&quot;\nShe said she feared communicating her concern with Jon: &quot;My stomach is turning because i know this is going to cause a huge fight.&quot;\n&quot;Any flak he receives turns into a huge blowup,&quot; she explained. &quot;I just didn&apos;t want to rock the boat, yet I wanted to do the right thing for my kids.&quot;\nWhen she broached the subject with Jon, he snapped, &quot;I cleared all the land - that&apos;s where they&apos;re going. Goodbye.&quot;\nSo Kate ended up asking the men from the playhouse company to tell Jon that the houses were too far away.  Said Kate, &quot;In the end, he relented and gave in and said that was fine. I guess it was because it wasn&apos;t me that was suggesting it directly to him, possibly.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jon Gosselin: &#8220;Kate and I Have Decided to Separate&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-06-23T02:55:40+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:56+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 897, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#respond"]}], "description": "\"If peace needs to be brought about by this, then I'm in agreement,\" she says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/", "name": "Jon Gosselin: \"Kate and I Have Decided to Separate\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-23T02:55:40+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:56+00:00", "description": "\"If peace needs to be brought about by this, then I'm in agreement,\" she says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Kate Gosselin and Jon Gosselin of TLC's \"Jon & Kate Plus 8\" attend Discovery Upfront on April 2, 2009 in New York City.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jon-gosselin-kate-and-i-have-decided-to-separate-2009226/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Jon Gosselin: &#8220;Kate and I Have Decided to Separate&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

The ceremony itself is exciting because most of the celebrities get hammered, make inappropriate comments in their acceptance speeches, or even bring their cocktails on stage with them while they&apos;re presenting awards (not that it wasn&apos;t entertaining, Harrison Ford).\r\nThis year was more gripping than most because, in an unprecedented awards show onanism, an actor and a director were nominated twice in the same category in the same year.  Clint Eastwood is up against himself as Best Director for his films Letters from Iwa Jima and Flags of Our Fathers. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio was twice nominated for Best Actor for his roles in The Departed and Blood Diamond.   Helen Mirren was recognized for playing both Elizabeth I in a TV miniseries and Elizabeth II in The Queen, but that monarch-on-monarch nomination was less surprising than the other double-noms (the royals do love them some incest, after all).   Anne Hathaway was shut out of the nominations for her role in The Devil Wears Prada, while Meryl Streep got the nod for Best Actress and Emily Blunt for Best Supporting Actress. Awk-ward!\r\nTo recap: Babel led the charge with seven nominations (including Best Drama), The Departed brought in six. Despite his anti-Semitic rant earlier this year, Mel Gibson&apos;s Apocalypto got a nom for Best Foreign Film Featuring People With Scary Things Stuck in Their Faces. Borat was nominated for Best Comedy or Musical to Draw the Ire of Both Kazakhstan and Racist Fraternity Brothers With Endangered Livers.\r\nFor the whole depraved list, click here.", "isPartOf":

she says. &quot;But he&apos;s able to do things with his body -- jump in the air and twist around and whatnot, so who knows what he&apos;s going to be able to pull off on the dance floor.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/melissa-joan-hart-i-hope-i-dont-throw-up-on-dwts-2009258/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 378}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Joan Hart", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/melissa-joan-hart/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/melissa-joan-hart-i-hope-i-dont-throw-up-on-dwts-2009258/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/melissa-joan-hart-i-hope-i-dont-throw-up-on-dwts-2009258/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Melissa Joan Hart: &#8220;I Hope I Don&#8217;t Throw Up&#8221;

After she was strangled, her body was stuffed into a suitcase and discarded in a dumpster in Buena Park, Calif. over the weekend.  \nSee today&apos;s celebrity news photos.\nHer ex-husband, VH1 reality star Ryan Jenkins, was charged with her murder Thursday and is believed to be on the run in Canada. Jenkins wed Fiore in Las Vegas in March, but their marriage was annulled in May after a &quot;big blowout,&quot; according to Fiore&apos;s mom, Lisa.\nJenkins &quot;is clearly dangerous, desperate and maybe armed. He has already murdered the person he was supposed to love the most. We are asking Jenkins to turn himself in and really appealing to people&apos;s moral right to come forward and turn him in because he is clearly dangerous,&quot; Emami says.  \nSee Hollywood&apos;s ugliest divorces of all time.\nThe U.S. Marshals Service is also offering a $25,000 reward for information on Jenkin&apos;s whereabouts. The DA&apos;s spokesperson says Jenkins has &quot;a great deal of financial resources...it appears his family has money,&quot; which he used to leave the country.\nAccording to TMZ.com, Jenkins was spotted leaving the L&apos;Auberge Del Mar hotel near San Diego Friday morning carrying a suitcase that may have contained Fiore&apos;s body.\nEmami says surveillance video shows Fiore and Jenkins checking into the hotel Thursday, but just Jenkins checking out Friday. &quot;The victim was not seen leaving with him, and she was not seen alive again,&quot; she adds.\nFiore&apos;s family is &quot;so devastated,&quot; Emami tells Us.\nMeanwhile, the producers behind the VH1 show in which he was supposed to appear, Megan Wants a Millionaire, say future airings will be &quot;postponed.&quot; They&apos;re blaming an error by a Canadian court clerk as to why he was able to pass a background check and star on the series.\nJenkins &#x2013; who earned the nickname &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; on Millionaire &#x2013; has a criminal history in his Calgary hometown. He was arrested in 2005 for punching an ex girlfriend who told the Calgary Herald he was a &quot;sex addict&quot; who had violent temper tantrums.\nHe was sentenced to 15 months of probation for assault, according to the Alberta, Canada Ministry of Justice (via the Associated Press).", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Slain Model Identified By Breast Implants After Fingers, Teeth Removed", "datePublished": "2009-08-21T23:29:32+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:58+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 461, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#respond"]}], "description": "A $25,000 reward is offered for info on Ryan Jenkins, who was charged with Jasmine Fiore's murder"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/", "name": "Slain Model Identified By Breast Implants After Fingers, Teeth Removed", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-08-21T23:29:32+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:57:58+00:00", "description": "A $25,000 reward is offered for info on Ryan Jenkins, who was charged with Jasmine Fiore's murder", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Ryan jasmine b_0_0", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slain-model-identified-by-breast-implants-after-fingers-teeth-removed-2009218/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Slain Model Identified By Breast Implants After Fingers, Teeth Removed"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

In the suit filed Wednesday, he claims he made a deal with Fawcett in 2004 to chronicle her life in Chasing Farrah, which aired, and has since worked with her on the current project, which is set to air Friday on NBC.  \nSee photos of stars in court.\n&quot;My intent today is the same as it always has been, since I started working with Farrah in 2004, and that is to creatively execute her artistic vision in projects that are a reflection of her,&quot; Nevius told Us Thursday. &quot;And at the same time to safeguard her right of privacy to the extent that she wants it safeguarded or protected, which changes depending on what she is willing to share.&quot;\nNevius added that the defendants &quot;began to take actions to wrongfully interfere with [his] contractual relationship with Ms. Fawcett&quot; and that O&apos;Neal made physical threats when he wouldn&apos;t relinquish control of the production company.\n&quot;This has been a very difficult time for Ryan O&apos;Neal and Farrah&apos;s family and friends,&quot; Fawcett&apos;s rep told Us. &quot;When you see something like this you have to question the motives of a person who can do something so hurtful during this very sensitive time in a person&apos;s life.&quot;  \nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\nThe documentarian is also suing Alana Stewart, Fawcett&apos;s friend, who apparently called Nevius in April saying that Fawcett &quot;wasn&apos;t doing well&quot; and wouldn&apos;t officially sign a deal.\nDespite the lawsuit, Stewart kept the focus on Fawcett&apos;s amazing resilience throughout her battle with cancer.  &quot;She&apos;s been amazing,&quot; Stewart said at the premiere of Farrah&apos;s Story in Beverly Hills on Wednesday. &quot;I&apos;m sure everyone who battles cancer has incredible strength and courage, but I have never experienced it so closely with anyone before. I&apos;m just blown away by ... her kindness for other people during the whole journey and her sense of humor.&quot;\nShe added: &quot;I mean, she has maintained a sense of humor during this whole journey, which is quite amazing.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/farrah-fawcett-shocked-by-tv-special-lawsuit-2009145/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Farrah Fawcett", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/farrah-fawcett/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ryan O'Neal", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/ryan-o-neal/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/farrah-fawcett-shocked-by-tv-special-lawsuit-2009145/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/farrah-fawcett-shocked-by-tv-special-lawsuit-2009145/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Farrah Fawcett &#8220;Shocked&#8221;

Next week, investigators plan to execute one more search warrant - possibly at a Los Angeles pharmacy -- in an attempt to gather more evidence, so the arrest would  likely happen the following week, according to the report.\r\n\r\nFox News reports that the Los Angeles District Attorney&apos;s office is currently in talks with investigators about whether they will offer Murray the option of surrendering in Los Angeles, or if he will be arrested in Houston, where he is currently staying.  Despite the L.A. District Attorney&apos;s Office statement that the story is  &quot;complete and totally false,&quot; Fox News stands by its report.  Murray reportedly told investigators he administered a fatal dose of the anesthetic propofol to Jackson in his rented Beverly Hills mansion in the hours before his June 25 death.  \r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, he posted a video on YouTube, stating: &quot;Please don&apos;t worry -- as long as I keep God in my heart and you in my life, I will be fine. I have done all I can do. I told the truth and I have faith that the truth will prevail.&quot;\r\n\r\nFox reports that Jackson&apos;s longtime dermatologist (and father of his two eldest children), Dr. Arnold Klein, will also be charged for medical malpractice.

She and beau Spencer Pratt -- who just attacked Mary-Kate Olsen after she said he had a bad temper in high school -- will head there in August to &quot;feed children and help build things.&quot;  (Pratt noted that they could adopt a baby while there, but Montag said, &quot;not right now. I think we&apos;d be married before we do that.&quot;)\r\nDespite Jesus teaching forgiveness, Montag says that rule likely won&apos;t apply to her relationship with Lauren Conrad.\r\n&quot;I don&apos;t think people are ever going to get that,&quot; she says of a reconciliation. (Still, she insists Conrad will &quot;always have a place in my heart.&quot;)\r\nOf Conrad&apos;s claim that Montag spread those sex tape rumors, Montag says: &quot;God knows the truth in all of this, and at the end of the day, that is the only thing that matters. Jesus was persecuted, and I&apos;m going to get persecuted, ya know?&quot;\r\nAs for the new season of The Hills (the first of 19 episodes debut August 18), Montag says viewers will get to meet her old sister Holly, an aspiring filmmaker who once lived with her and Conrad.\r\n\r\n&quot;Holly and Lauren were inseparable for a while,&quot;

Not just one person was involved, rather it was a conspiracy of people. He was surrounded by a bad circle. Michael was a very meek, quiet, loving person. People took advantage of that. People fought to be close to him, people who weren&apos;t always on his side.&quot;\r\n\r\nShe blamed this &quot;shadowy entourage&quot; for supplying him with prescription drugs.  &quot;They got him hooked on drugs,&quot; she said. &quot;He was pure and clean and then drugs came back into his system. I think it shocked his system so much it killed him.&quot;  Although results from toxicology tests will take a few more weeks to reveal a definitive cause of death, La Toya -- who signed Michael&apos;s death certificate on June 25 after he suffered a cardiac arrest at the age of 50 -- is certain the investigation will reveal her worst fears.\r\n\r\n&quot;He had needle marks on his neck and on his arms and more about those will emerge in the next few weeks,&quot; she said. &quot; I cannot discuss that any further as I may jeopardise the investigation. I can, however, say that I have not changed my mind about my feeling that Michael was murdered.&quot;  She added: &quot;It will all come out. You will be shocked.&quot;  La Toya, 53, also asserts that Michael -- whom she said &quot;was the loneliest man in the world&quot; -- was forced into doing 50 concerts in London and was kept away from his family as he went to rehearsals, costume fittings and vocal lessons at all hours.  &quot;It&apos;s impossible even for a healthy person to do that many shows,&quot; she said. &quot;Michael was fragile. He always wanted to believe the best of people. But he was meek. In the last few months, he became isolated. I believe the staff were given strict instructions that if any of the family called, not to tell him. And if any of the family came by, not to let them in.&quot;\r\n\r\nShe said that throughout her and her family&apos;s mourning, they plan to file a civil lawsuit against anyone -- which could potentially include Michael&apos;s personal doctor, Conrad Murray, whom La Toya said &quot;disappeared&quot; after she sought answers from him -- they believe responsible, as well as pushing for police to serve criminal charges.   &quot;I am going to get down to the bottom of this,&quot; she said. &quot;I am not going to stop until I find out who is responsible. Why did they keep the family away? It&apos;s not about money. I want justice for Michael. I won&apos;t rest until I find out what -- and who -- killed my brother.&quot;  La Toya is equally determined to resolve the custody battle between Katherine Jackson and Debbie Rowe over Michael&apos;s two eldest children, Prince, 12, and Paris, 11 (La Toya confirms that Blanket, 7, was conceived with a donor egg and donated sperm and that his biological parents are unknown).\r\n\r\n&quot;These are not Debbie&apos;s kids,&quot; she said. &quot;They don&apos;t even know she&apos;s their mother. Like everyone else in his life, she was motivated by money. She has always said she&apos;s not their mother. My understanding is that she will now go after the kids. I know a few things about Debbie, and I will prevent that from happening.&quot;  In the end, La Toya -- the sibling her family said had &quot;a special bond&quot; with the star -- said she won&apos;t rest until she finds out the truth about the King of Pop&apos;s death.  &quot;I&apos;m doing what I can to find out how he died. If he died of a drug overdose, then I want to find who supplied him the drugs and who first introduced him to them,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;ve still not had a chance to speak to Dr. Murray about Michael&apos;s final days. I need to know what he may have seen or heard.&quot;  She added: &quot;Michael didn&apos;t have to die. We are all mourning his loss, more than anyone can ever know. But we are also determined to get to the bottom of what happened to him.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Debbie Rowe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/debbie-rowe/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Katherine Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/katherine-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "LaToya Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/latoya-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Paris Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/paris-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Prince Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/prince-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "LaToya Jackson: &#8220;Michael Was Murdered&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-07-12T01:06:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:40+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 940, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#respond"]}], "description": "\"He was surrounded by a bad circle\" who got him hooked on drugs, the late singer's sister says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/", "name": "LaToya Jackson: \"Michael Was Murdered\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-12T01:06:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:40+00:00", "description": "\"He was surrounded by a bad circle\" who got him hooked on drugs, the late singer's sister says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Michael and LaToya Jackson at the BET Awards, June 2003.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/latoya-jackson-michael-was-murdered-2009117/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "LaToya Jackson: &#8220;Michael Was Murdered&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Last week it was revealed that the Republican National Committee shelled out more than $150,000 to dress the hockey mom. (Palin said the clothes were not worth that amount; John McCain said her designer duds will be donated to charity after the election.)\r\n\r\n&quot;Who is the real Sarah Palin? The Wal-Mart hockey mom or a clothes horse?&quot; The View&apos;s Joy Behar asked on Monday&apos;s show.   Hasselbeck - who introduced Palin at a rally in Florida Sunday - said they &quot;talked&quot; about the issue ... and that Palin is &quot;not a fashionista, by any means.&quot;  &quot;She called Jimmy Choos Johnny Choos,&quot; Hasselbeck said.\r\n\r\nBarbara Walters said the scrutiny isn&apos;t necessarily &quot;Sarah Palin&apos;s fault.  &quot;I think this is the Republican party&apos;s fault. ... I traveled all over the country, took black pants, a black skirt and three jackets and did not have to spend that kind of money,&quot; she said.  Behar added that Palin could&apos;ve said, &quot;&apos;I don&apos;t want to wear those clothes because I&apos;m presenting myself as this Wal-Mart hockey mom.&apos;&quot;  Walters also mentioned that Hasselbeck may have thought the attention on clothes was sexist, but she still addressed it at Sunday&apos;s rally instead of dropping it.  &quot;I wanted it to end,&quot; Hasselbeck explained.  At the rally, Hasselbeck said the focus on Palin&apos;s clothes was &quot;deliberately sexist.&quot;  Palin told the roaring crowd that her jacket at the Sunday&apos;s rally was from her &quot;favorite consignment shop in Anchorage, Alaska.&quot;  She added that the wedding ring from her husband Todd is &quot;a $35 wedding ring from Hawaii that I bought myself ...&apos;cause I always thought with my ring, it&apos;s not what it&apos;s made of, it&apos;s what it represents and 20 years later, [I&apos;m] happy to wear it.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "John McCain", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/john-mccain/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joy Behar", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/joy-behar/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Palin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/sarah-palin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck: Sarah Palin&#8217;s No &#8220;Fashionista&#8221;", "datePublished": "2008-10-27T18:26:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:20+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 396, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": ["Celebrity Style"], "articleSection": ["Star Style"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#respond"]}], "description": "Despite wearing $150,000 in designer duds, \"she called Jimmy Choos Johnny Choos,\" says The View star"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/", "name": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck: Sarah Palin's No \"Fashionista\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2008-10-27T18:26:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:20+00:00", "description": "Despite wearing $150,000 in designer duds, \"she called Jimmy Choos Johnny Choos,\" says The View star", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/elisabeth-hasselbeck-sarah-palins-no-fashionista-20082710/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck introduces Republican U.S. vice presidential Candidate Alaska Gov.

But they went and added all these other shows.&quot;  Adds Joe, &quot;I was worried about his health because all the shows that I&apos;m seeing -- no artist can do those many shows you know, back to back like that,&quot; Joe Jackson said. &quot;And so I knew Michael couldn&apos;t do all those shows.&quot;\r\nSee Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\r\nLongtime friend and sometimes financial advisor Leonard Rowe, no relation to Jackson&apos;s ex-wife Debbie Rowe, also had his concerns.  &quot;Michael Jackson was not ready. He was not fit,&quot; Rowe says, &quot;[unless] you can call weighting 110, 115 pounds fit.&quot;\r\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s apperance has changed over the years\r\nBut the tour&apos;s producers have said that Michael was in top form and would have had lots of rest during the run, which would have extended through March 2010.\r\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s unforgettable life\r\nAEG Live CEO Randy Phillips says Jackson would have averaged two-and-a-quarter shows per week. &quot;If that was too many, then one would have been too many,&quot; he tells ABC News. He adds that it was Michael&apos;s idea to up the amount of performances to 50, from the original 31.  But Rowe says he called Phillips before the singer&apos;s death and tried to get him to agree to a lower number of shows, but Rowe says Phillips &quot;told me to shove off. He didn&apos;t want to talk about it.&quot;   Over the weekend, LaToya Jackson told British press she believes Michael was &quot;murdered&quot; as part of a conspiracy to steal his money and assets.  Joe Jackson agrees.  &quot;I do believe it was foul play,&quot; he tells ABC News. &quot;I do believe that. Yes.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Debbie Rowe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/debbie-rowe/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joe Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/joe-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "LaToya Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/latoya-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Michael Jackson Was to Have Kicked Off London Tour Today", "datePublished": "2009-07-13T15:57:32+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:43+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 446, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#respond"]}], "description": "If still alive, the singer would never have been able to complete all 50 shows, says dad Joe Jackson"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/", "name": "Michael Jackson Was to Have Kicked Off London Tour Today", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-13T15:57:32+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:43+00:00", "description": "If still alive, the singer would never have been able to complete all 50 shows, says dad Joe Jackson", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "November 15, 2006", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/michael-jackson-was-to-have-kicked-off-london-tour-today-2009137/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Michael Jackson Was to Have Kicked Off London Tour Today"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

But &quot;their contact was minimal,&quot; the source tells Us.\r\n\r\nCorey Feldman -- who sported a Jackson look from his Dangerous era -- befriended the singer in the 1980s as a teen, but they drifted apart and didn&apos;t speak for several years before his death.  Many of Jackson&apos;s actual friends were not present.   Diana Ross -- who was named as a backup guardian to Jackson&apos;s three children after his mom, Katherine -- issued a statement instead of attending.\r\n\r\nArnold Klein, Jackson&apos;s longtime dermatologist and biological father to his two oldest children, was also noticeably absent.   Both ex wives Debbie Rowe and Lisa Marie Presley also stayed home.   Taylor said she was asked to speak but Tweeted she couldn&apos;t &quot;be a part of the public whoopla&quot; or guarantee &quot;that I would be coherent to say a word.&quot;  Producer Quincy Jones, who helped launch Jackson&apos;s career, said he couldn&apos;t &quot;handle it&quot; and instead went to a charity event in Europe.\r\n\r\nMacaulay Culkin -- who became friends with Jackson as a kid, and even defended him at his molestation trial (he was acquitted)  -- skipped it.   Even Jesse Jackson, who counseled the singer during his trial, was not present to speak.
