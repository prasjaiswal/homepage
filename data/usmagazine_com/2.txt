The cause of death was cerebral vascular disease.  He leaves behind three children, Nancy and Kathy, son Walter III, and four grandchildren. His wife of 64 years, Betsy, died in 2005.  Dubbed &quot;the most trusted man in America&quot; for his unflappability during some of the most tumultuous and exciting moments of the 20th Century, Cronkite was also affectionately known to generations of TV watchers as &quot;Uncle Walter&quot; during his tenure as anchorman for the CBS Evening News from 1962-1981.  Born on November 4, 1916 in St. Joseph, MO., Walter Leland Cronkite Jr&apos;s destiny was forged from an early age after reading an article about the adventurous world of reporters in a boys&apos; magazine.  Kicking off his journalistic career on his high school newspaper, Cronkite&apos;s first job was as a part-time reporter at the Houston Post in the 1930s.  In 1939, Cronkite traveled to Europe as a war correspondent for the United Press, where he made his name covering some of the most important events of the time including the Battle of the Bulge, the D-Day invasion and the Nuremberg Trials.  Hired by CBS&apos;s Edward R. Murrow in 1950, Cronkite earned the respect of Americans for his breaking of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.  His subsequent coverage of the American moon landing in 1969 further cemented his status as one of America&apos;s most respected and trusted voices.  Cronkite retired in 1981 and handed over the reigns of the newscast to Dan Rather but remained a presence in Americans lives as an elder statesman and living legend of broadcasting.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Walter Cronkite Dies At Age 92", "datePublished": "2009-07-18T01:31:01+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:56+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 320, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#respond"]}], "description": "The legendary newsman passed away Friday night in New York"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/", "name": "Walter Cronkite Dies At Age 92", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-18T01:31:01+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:56+00:00", "description": "The legendary newsman passed away Friday night in New York", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Walter Cronkite at the 2007 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on February 25, 2007", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/walter-cronkite-dies-at-age-92-2009177/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Walter Cronkite Dies At Age 92"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

But Johnston -- the father of 18-year-old Bristol Palin&apos;s baby, Tripp -- thinks Letterman wasn&apos;t being malicious.  \nSee photos of shocking star teen pregnancies.\n&quot;I don&apos;t think he meant to hurt anybody,&quot; says Johnston, 19. &quot;He&apos;s a comedian. That&apos;s what he does...People are going to make jokes and there&apos;re going to talk and say whatever they want. You can&apos;t do nothing about it.  &quot;[But] there&apos;s somewhere you have to draw the line with some things....&quot; Johnston continues.\nOn Friday&apos;s Today show, Palin slammed the talk show host for making a quip about her daughter getting &quot;knocked up&quot; by Alex Rodriquez during a recent visit to Yankees stadium.  \nCheck out Hollywood&apos;s craziest celeb scandals.\n&quot;I would like to see him apologize to young women across the country for contributing to kind of that thread that is throughout our culture that makes it sound like it is OK to talk about young girls in that way, where it&apos;s kind of OK, accepted and funny to talk about statutory rape,&quot; the Alaskan governor said. &quot;It&apos;s not cool. It&apos;s not funny.&quot;\nLetterman had claimed he was joking about Bristol, not 14-year-old daughter, Willow (who was at the ball park), but Palin was still fuming about the &quot;degrading comment about a young woman.\nSee the day&apos;s hottest celebrity photos.\n&quot;No wonder young girls especially have such low self-esteem in America when we think it&apos;s funny for a so-called comedian to get away with such a remark as he did,&quot;

Tim Leiweke, the CEO of AEG Live, which owns the Staples Center, announced that 17,500 tickets will be made available to fans via an Internet lottery at the venue&apos;s Web site. Online registration -- which does not guarantee a ticket for the memorial service -- concludes Saturday, July 4 at 6 p.m. PST. As of 9 a.m. PST Saturday, the Web site had received 1,223,978 ticket registrations.\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nTuesday&apos;s service, celebrating the life of The King of Pop, will take place at the same venue (capacity: 20,000) where Jackson rehearsed for his London concert tour just two days before he died on June 25 at age 50.   A simulcast of the memorial service will occur at the Nokia Theater across the street. Randomly selected ticketholders notified on Sunday, July 5 will receive wristbands for one location or the other. The remaining tickets are set aside for the Jackson family to allocate as they see fit.   \nRevisit Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\n No other details of the memorial were made available, though officials confirmed there would be no funeral procession, in an effort to maintain crowd control.  On Thursday, Jackson&apos;s brother, Jermaine, told CNN&apos;s Larry King the public&apos;s safety was paramount when it came to making plans for the memorial.\nSee photos of the singer and his children\n&quot;The hardest thing is, where do you rest Michael Jackson?&quot; he said in an interview at Neverland Ranch. &quot;Everything [Michael] did was so over the top, and there are people coming from all over the world in groups of 20s and hundreds of thousands.  &quot;We worked with the city authorities and they&apos;re trying their best,&quot; he continued. &quot;And with the time frame we have, we&apos;re hoping that everybody is safe and things are going to be locked down pretty much.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Larry King", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/larry-king/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Michael Jackson&#8217;s Public Memorial to Be Held Tuesday", "datePublished": "2009-07-03T18:30:57+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:27+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 396, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#respond"]}], "description": "The family makes 17,500 tickets available to fans via online lottery"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/", "name": "Michael Jackson's Public Memorial to Be Held Tuesday", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-03T18:30:57+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:27+00:00", "description": "The family makes 17,500 tickets available to fans via online lottery", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Michael Jackson emerges from the courtroom for a break during closing arguments in his child molestation trial at Santa Barbara County Superior Court on June 3, 2005 in Santa Maria, California.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jacksons-public-memorial-to-be-held-tuesday-200937/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Michael Jackson&#8217;s Public Memorial to Be Held Tuesday"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

I came to understand that the hole a man leaves when he abandons his responsibility to his children is one that no government can fill. We can do everything possible to provide good jobs and good schools and safe streets for our kids, but it will never be enough to fully make up the difference.\nCheck out star dads&apos; personal kid photos\n&quot;We need fathers to step up, to realize that their job does not end at conception; that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one.\n&quot;I know I have been an imperfect father. I know I have made mistakes. I have lost count of all the times, over the years, when the demands of work have taken me from the duties of fatherhood. There were many days out on the campaign trail when I felt like my family was a million miles away, and I knew I was missing moments of my daughters&apos; lives that I&apos;d never get back.

The bleeding created a sac of blood that caused pressure and pain, he continued.  The actress, 62, revealed she had anal cancer in 2006. The following year, she held a press conference to announce she was in remission, but her cancer returned shortly after.\r\nSee photos of stars who beat cancer. The recent operation was related to the spread of cancer to the liver, her doctor added.   Despite reports on RadarOnline.com that she was unconscious, her doctor told Reuters: &quot;She remains in good spirits with her usual sense of humor...If everything goes as we hope, we plan to discharge her later in the week.&quot;  Her longtime boyfriend Ryan O&apos;Neal asked fans to &quot;pray for her&quot; but said, &quot;this is not at death&apos;s door.&quot;  Fawcett&apos;s unconventional treatments she&apos;s receiving in Germany will be broadcast in an NBC documentary, A Wing and a Prayer.\r\nSee the day&apos;s top news photos.\r\n&quot;It&apos;s never had anything to do with stem cells,&quot; or alternative treatments like shark cartilage, coffee enemas or unproven &quot;detoxification&quot; diets, the documentary&apos;s producer Craig Nevius said.  &quot;It&apos;s much more scientific than that. It&apos;s not a fringe treatment,&quot; he said, and the doctors have &quot;multiple, multiple degrees.&quot;  In an earlier statement, Nevius said Fawcett was grateful to &quot;her fans, who have offered their constant support throughout her fight, as well as out of concern for the countless of other cancer patients who have written to her to say that they are following her story in the hope that there is hope.&quot;  Meanwhile, her troubled 24-year-old son Redmond O&apos;Neal was arrested on suspicion of bringing narcotics into a jail facility after admitting he was carrying drugs, L.A. Sheriff&apos;s spokesman Steve Whitmore confirms. He is being held on $25,000 bail.\r\nSee photos of star mug shots.\r\nRedmond and his father Ryan were arrested last September on suspicion of meth possession after police raided their Malibu home.

I&apos;ve been able to surround myself professionally with a ton of great people and that&apos;s from my management, my label, all the way down to my fans.&quot;  &quot;The condolences and well wishes sent my way in the last month-and-a-half have been unreal,&quot; he said.\r\nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars gone too soon\r\nAt age 26, Adam was diagnosed with brain cancer. And, throughout his battle, Cook said Adam &quot;was defiant almost to a fault.&quot;  &quot;The doctors, when they first diagnosed him, gave him about two years. And every time they would give him a diagnosis of a definite amount of time, he would always seem to exceed it,&quot;  he said. &quot;And I remember I took a couple of days off from this tour that we&apos;d been on back in March because we got bad news that it was going to be a few days at best and then, of course, he lasted seven more weeks.&quot;\r\nAdam succumbed to the disease May 2 at age 37.  Cook learned of his brother&apos;s passing while he was in Washington, D.C. for the Race for Hope, a fundraiser for brain cancer research.   &quot;I would say the actual event was unexpected, but we kind of knew for a while that Adam was heading in that direction,&quot; Cook said. &quot;Now that it&apos;s done and it&apos;s over with, it gives us a chance as a family to kind of regroup and move on and, hopefully, make sure that, you know, his memory just kind of lives on.&quot;\r\nSee where your favorite American Idol contestants are now\r\nCook remembers his brother -- who is survived by wife Kendra and their two children -- as &quot;amazing, definitely one of my best friends, one of my biggest advisers.&quot;  Added Cook, &quot;He was important to everybody that knew him, which is very cool.&quot;\r\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos\r\nCook said his brother &quot;maintained his sense of humor all the way to the end. And the biggest lesson I took from Adam was that [cancer] never defined him. It was never a character trait or a personality trait.  It was just an illness. I definitely think that Adam passed with all of his dignity intact.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "David Cook", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/david-cook/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "David Cook: Fans Helping Him Cope With Brother&#8217;s Death", "datePublished": "2009-06-16T17:39:42+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:47+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 458, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#respond"]}], "description": "\"The condolences and well wishes sent my way in the last month-and-a-half have been unreal,\" he says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/", "name": "David Cook: Fans Helping Him Cope With Brother's Death", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-16T17:39:42+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:47+00:00", "description": "\"The condolences and well wishes sent my way in the last month-and-a-half have been unreal,\" he says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/david-cook-fans-helping-him-cope-with-brothers-death-2009166/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "David Cook arrives at the American Idol Season 8 Grand Finale held at Nokia Theatre L.A.

Jackson also reportedly had unexplained bruises on his knees and shins and bruising to his back, indicating a recent fall.  He was bald, the paper reports, with his shoulder-length hair just a wig. His hair has been reduced to a &quot;peach fuzz&quot; on his scalp, says the paper.\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed\nThe only thing pathologists found in the star&apos;s stomach were partially dissolved pills, which were removed for toxicology tests, according to the Sun.\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nSeveral of Jackson&apos;s ribs also had been broke as paramedics tried to revive the singer after he suffered cardiac arrest at his rented L.A. home, according to reports. There also were four injections around his heart, presumably from adrenaline shots during the failed resuscitation.\n&quot;He was skin and bone, his hair had fallen out and he had been eating nothing but pills when he died,&quot; the paper quotes a source as saying.  &quot;Injection marks all over his body and the disfigurement caused by years of plastic surgery show he&apos;d been in terminal decline for years.  \nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\nTwo autopsies were conducted on Jackson: One by the Los Angeles coroner and another by a private pathologist hired by the Jackson family.\nOn Sunday, a lawyer for Dr. Conrad Murray - the singer&apos;s private pathologist who discovered Jackson in bed and not breathing last Thursday - denied various media reports that Dr. Conrad prescribed or gave Jackson the drugs Demerol or OxyContin.   &quot;Not ever.

(Blanket was probably the youngest in the group.)  \r\nJackson&apos;s children seemed very close with their cousins, as they all were playing and goofing around.\r\nAt one point, Prince Michael pulled out his cell phone. It looked like he was playing a game on it; he then passed it along to one of his cousins.\r\n\r\nBlanket &#x2013; who appeared overwhelmed at the memorial &#x2013; was in a much better mood. He looked like he was having so much fun chasing around his cousins. The boy &#x2013; whose hair is almost down to his waist and whose front tooth is missing &#x2013; appeared playful at the reception, tickling his cousins and tapping others on the shoulder and then running away.\r\nParis also seemed to be in a better mood. She hugged her cousins and chatted with guests.\r\nAt one point, someone brought over the program from the memorial and all three of the kids &#x2013; including some of the cousins &#x2013; gathered around to look at the pictures.\r\nJackson&apos;s children seemed really poised and polite as they shook guests&apos; hands and chatted with them. People were coming up and shaking Prince Michael&apos;s hand a lot. The kids interacted extremely naturally with each other.\r\n\r\nGrace Rwaramba, Jackson&apos;s former nanny, was overheard saying: &quot;The kids are holding up really well. It&apos;s good for them to be around the other kids.&quot;\r\nThe reception featured a classical music quartet that played softly onstage. (Food included mini cheeseburgers, spanakopita, mini crab cakes, vegetable plates, cheese plates and fruit.)\r\nTodd Bridges, Corey Feldman, Chris Tucker, Brooke Shields, Wesley Snipes, Rev. Al Sharpton, Kim Porter, Mariah Carey, Jesse Jackson, Spike Lee and Anil Kapoor from Slumdog Millionaire were among the guests.  \r\nUsher pretty much kept to himself and still looked sad.\r\nAs for Jackson&apos;s siblings, Latoya made the rounds at the reception, greeting guests. Janet did not really interact with her family, only to chat with sister Latoya momentarily. (Both ladies kept their sunglasses on the entire time.)  Janet also carried around Blanket&apos;s Michael Jackson doll for him. (Her beau Jermaine Dupri did not attend.)\r\nJoe and Katherine Jackson briefly chatted up Brooke Shields, who was smiling but still mourning as her eyes were red.\r\n \r\nJermaine Jackson talked to family members and hugged a lot of the guests.\r\nAt the end of the evening, a few guests took photos with Wesley Snipes, Usher and even Joe Jackson.\r\nFeldman, still dressed in his bizarre Michael Jackson outfit, gave Joe Jackson a hug and a handshake on the way out.\r\nMichael&apos;s three kids left with Katherine Jackson, who remains their temporary guardian until a July 13 court hearing.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jacksons-kids-in-better-spirits-at-post-memorial-reception-200987/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Al Sharpton", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/al-sharpton/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brooke Shields", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/brooke-shields/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Corey Feldman", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/corey-feldman/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Janet Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/janet-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jermaine Dupri", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jermaine-dupri/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jesse Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jesse-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Katherine Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/katherine-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Porter", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kim-porter/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "LaToya Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/latoya-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mariah Carey", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/mariah-carey/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Spike Lee", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/spike-lee/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Usher", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/usher/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Wesley Snipes", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/wesley-snipes/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jacksons-kids-in-better-spirits-at-post-memorial-reception-200987/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jacksons-kids-in-better-spirits-at-post-memorial-reception-200987/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jackson&#8217;s Kids in Better Spirits at Post-Memorial Reception", "datePublished": "2009-07-08T13:42:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:37+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jacksons-kids-in-better-spirits-at-post-memorial-reception-200987/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 693, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jacksons-kids-in-better-spirits-at-post-memorial-reception-200987/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jacksons-kids-in-better-spirits-at-post-memorial-reception-200987/#respond"]}], "description": "Paris, 11, greeted and talked to guests;

Meet Jon Gosselin&apos;s new women.\r\nWhat sparked the fight?\r\nJon says he called babysitter Stephanie Santoro &#x2013; a 23-year-old single mother and aspiring model who has stayed overnight and partied with Jon &#x2013; to watch the kids while he was filming Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8.\r\nWatch Kate&apos;s appearance on Live With Regis and Kelly.\r\n&quot;I guess she didn&apos;t agree with my babysitting,&quot; Jon says of Kate, adding that it was the first time he&apos;d seen his ex wife for &quot;a long time&quot; (they announced they were separating in June).\r\nWhen asked why Kate was upset about Santoro (who also works as a &quot;shooter girl&quot; selling shots at local club Legends), Jon says, &quot;I have no idea.

It makes me feel bad that obviously I made people feel that I would be corny enough to say something so whack after the passing of an idol, a legend and more than that, a human being with feelings and family.&quot;\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life in photos.\nHe continued: &quot;It scares me to think what people will believe, without even a source. Any random person can type something on the internet and then the world believes it. I don&apos;t talk to press or do TV or do promotions of any sort. I&apos;ve stopped chasing and buying into fame. Fame is like cigarettes with no surgeon general warning. It destroys most people as it did to the true and only king of pop.

Megan Fox isn&apos;t one of them.\n&quot;It&apos;s a lack of creativity on the media&apos;s part,&quot; the Transformers star says in the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly (on newsstands June 12). &quot;Because I have tattoos and dark hair and I was in an action movie? That&apos;s as far as the similarities extend.&quot;\nSee if you can guess which star legs belong to Megan and Angelina!\nAdds Fox, &quot;I&apos;m not the next anyone.&quot;  The 23-year-old actress -- who says she was joking when she once said she was afraid of the Changeling star -- admits that she has no plans to get to know Jolie.   \nSee what Megan Fox and all the stars wore to the 2009 MTV Movie Awards!\n&quot;She always seems otherworldly in her power and her confidence,&quot; Fox says. &quot;I&apos;m sure she has no idea who I am. But if I were her, I&apos;d be like, &apos;Who the f--- is this little bulls--- brat who was in Transformers that&apos;s going to be the next me?&apos; I don&apos;t want to meet her. I&apos;d be embarrassed.&quot;\nFox even interjects when asked if she wanted to follow in Jolie&apos;s footsteps of starting out as a sex symbol before taking on serious roles.  &quot;Angelina Jolie was always a Method actress,&quot; she says. &quot;She&apos;d been nominated for Golden Globes before she ever did Tomb Raider.&quot;  \nSee photos of Angelina Jolie through the years.\nStill, the star -- who admits &quot;I&apos;m clearly not ugly&quot; -- isn&apos;t bothered by the fact that she&apos;s seen as a sex symbol.\n&quot;I don&apos;t know why someone would complain about that,&quot; she says. &quot;That just means that the bar has been set pretty low. People don&apos;t expect me to do anything that&apos;s worth watching. So I can only be an overachiever. I think all women in Hollywood are known as sex symbols. That&apos;s what our purpose is in this business. You&apos;re merchandised, you&apos;re a product. You&apos;re sold and it&apos;s based on sex. But that&apos;s okay. I think women should be empowered by that, not degraded.&quot;\nIn fact, she doesn&apos;t regret how Transformers made her &quot;this new girl&quot; in the industry.  \nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\n&quot;I happened to be such an outrageous personality that people wanted to start writing about me because it was deemed controversial,&quot; she says. &quot;I think if I had been a typical Hollywood actress and I said all the right things and I had been a publicity android, it wouldn&apos;t have escalated to this level.&quot;\nFox, who appears in this summer&apos;s blockbuster Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, doesn&apos;t want to still be making robot movies five years from now, but when asked what the worst-case scenario would be, she says, &quot;That I&apos;d be on The Hills.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Angelina Jolie", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/angelina-jolie/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Megan Fox", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/megan-fox/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Megan Fox: Stop Comparing Me to Angelina Jolie!", "datePublished": "2009-06-11T17:22:30+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:36+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 559, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Entertainment"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#respond"]}], "description": "\"I have tattoos and dark hair and I was in an action movie...That's as far as the similarities [go],\" she says"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/", "name": "Megan Fox: Stop Comparing Me to Angelina Jolie!", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-11T17:22:30+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:55:36+00:00", "description": "\"I have tattoos and dark hair and I was in an action movie...That's as far as the similarities ,\" she says", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Fox jolie b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/megan-fox-stop-comparing-me-to-angelina-jolie-2009116/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Megan Fox: Stop Comparing Me to Angelina Jolie!"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

I just don&apos;t want to believe it,&quot; he told Usmagazine.com when reached by phone Thursday evening.  \r\n\r\nJackson was best man when Geller renewed his wedding vows in 2001.  \r\n\r\nAdded Geller, &quot;He is my best friend. I just can&apos;t believe.&quot;\r\nSee more of today&apos;s top celeb news photos\r\nGeller also told Sky News that he believed Jackson to be in fine health.  &quot;He was in good shape. ... I&apos;m not a doctor, but I can only assume he was under immense stresses and pressures, and you can ask any doctor, stress is a killer,&quot; he said. &quot;The pressure of these concerts, putting under huge pressures, he was a perfectionist. That could have been what did it. But that&apos;s just my opinion.&quot;\r\nJackson was set to headline 50 sold-out shows at London&apos;s O2 Arena beginning in July, billed &quot;This Is It&quot; -- his final London performances.  &quot;I think it was a mistake to target 50 shows. 3, 4, 5 maybe 10 shows is enough,&quot; said Geller. &quot;He was healthy, aerobically fit. I remember him here in my house, and he wouldn&apos;t touch junk food. So now... to confront this devastating reality that Michael is dead is just... I want to wake up tomorrow and think this is a dream and that he is not dead.&quot;\r\nAdded Geller, &quot;He was a happy man when fans were around - he drank their love. He loved what he did, but somewhere in his deep dark corners of his heart, he was a confused man and a lonely person.

I apologize that I did not make a statement earlier as I have been feeling pretty beat up over the last few days. The fact is I was honored to be asked to perform at the event. The entire &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; production were awesome and even though I was completely out of my element I was really enjoying myself prior to my injury. In fact all involved at the awards show treated me good.&quot;\n&quot;I had a great time at the Tonys right up until I got blindsided, I must admit it was a little blurry after that. In hindsight, there is no doubt I got my bell rung, unfortunately it has been posted and perhaps funny to watch, but I can assure you it has been painful to experience. In all honesty I had absolutely no idea what struck my head. Upon impact I thought a piece of the lighting rig had fallen out of the ceiling and as I fell back it seemed like my head struck the stage and I blacked out for a second. When I opened my eyes I noticed a large set prop coming down straight for me. I immediately pushed myself out of the way and amidst the chaos I laid on the floor and asked &quot;what the hell just happened?&quot;   \nSee more rocking celeb romances\n&quot;My nose, mouth and the back of my head felt numb. I vaguely remember asking Big John, &apos;Do I have any teeth left in my mouth?&apos; I knew I could move my arms and legs and that was an instant relief. Somebody handed me a towel to wipe the blood from my face and in my dazed state I recall staring at what seemed to be Shrek, a talking goat head and several monkey like creatures.&quot;\n&quot;Over the last few days a lot of speculation as to what happened and who is to blame have surfaced. I need to make clear at no point since the incident occurred do I feel like the accident was malicious in any way and I feel this will all work itself out. However I must state I found it a little strange that the only statement released by the Tony organization was that I missed my mark and that I was completely fine. First, I thought, &apos;what mark?&apos; as there was no official mark, just a retracting drum riser and an overhead prop being rapidly lowered which was out of my view. Second, I think it was slightly irresponsible for them to report that I was fine without full knowledge of my condition, when a doctor hadn&apos;t even looked at me yet and I surely don&apos;t remember any X-Ray machines backstage. I am not looking for an apology, I only hoped that on a human level that the Tony organizations&apos; representative would have expressed some concern for injury in their statement or at the very least claim they would be looking into the matter.&quot;\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news pics\nFind out Bret Michael&apos;s celeb crush\nSee then-and-now shots of Neil Patrick Harris and other 90 TV stars", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bret-michaels-i-got-blindsided-at-the-tonys-2009116/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Bret Michaels", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/bret-michaels/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bret-michaels-i-got-blindsided-at-the-tonys-2009116/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bret-michaels-i-got-blindsided-at-the-tonys-2009116/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Bret Michaels: I Got &#8220;Blindsided&#8221;

Seacrest had gotten up next to the actress and beau Brad Pitt, hoping to score an interview on E!&apos;s pre-show. &quot;Hi, guys. Brad? Angelina?&quot; he said, but they ignored his advance and brushed by him.   \nSee party pics from the 2009 Golden Globe Awards!\nSeacrest&apos;s take on the incident?  &quot;I don&apos;t think Angelina thinks I&apos;m that important,&quot; he said on his show Monday. &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;m top of mind for Brad and Angelina. I honestly don&apos;t believe they&apos;d know who I was if I walked over there.&quot;  \nSee what Angelina Jolie and all the stars wore to the 2009 Golden Globe Awards!\nWhen guest Perez Hilton told Seacrest that that&apos;s impossible, as he hosts the No. 1 show American Idol, the TV personality shot back: &quot;Yeah...but they live in France!&quot;  \nLook back at Brad and Angelina&apos;s most romantic moments.\nJolie and Pitt did stop for NBC&apos;s Billy Bush, but Seacrest said, &quot;there&apos;s an NBC deal there. NBC hosted the Globes, and they have a deal to talk to the people who come to the Globes.  &quot;Here&apos;s what I realized when I went down there,&quot; Seacrest went on. &quot;I realized quickly that it&apos;s against the rules to walk down onto the carpet from the platform.  \nSee how Angelina Jolie&apos;s red carpet style has changed over the years.\n&quot;Then we went back down there and caught up with Tom Cruise, who I think is a terrific guy. I think he&apos;s really cool,&quot; he said. &quot;By the way, have you seen his skin tone up close lately? You should!&quot;  Seacrest clashed with Jolie before: At the 2006 Golden Globes, he asked her what she fed her children that day and she icily replied &quot; Cereal &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201D; we made cereal.&quot;    He later called her &quot;cold&quot; for being so unresponsive.

It never happened!&quot;\r\nKathy Griffin -- who also appeared on The View Friday -- joked that she&apos;d pay the lad mag to let her pose nude dressed up as Kate.\r\nCheck out Kate&apos;s high school yearbook photo\r\n&quot;Why don&apos;t we do a nude...lesbo thing?&quot; Griffin asked Kate.\r\nHer response?\r\n&quot;Oh, wow,&quot; Kate said.\r\nKate also told Griffin she laughed at a video the comic filmed for Jimmy Kimmel Live. In the clip, Griffin dons a wig, screams at her kids and rolls her eyes as estranged husband Jon -- played by Star Trek&apos;s George Takei -- makes out with a cheerleader.\r\n&quot;I watched it online and I didn&apos;t know what to expect,&quot; she said. &quot;I caught myself cracking up out loud.\r\nKate -- who was back to her wavy &apos;do -- also discussed tabloid reports that Jon&#xA0;slept with a former nanny, Stephanie Santoro, while his kids were home.\r\n&quot;Well, I guess it&apos;s the article of the week and basically my only comment on that -- just based on the behavior of the last several months -- I&apos;m not surprised,&quot; Kate said. &quot;Honestly, I don&apos;t know. We were separated. It goes back to the recent police being called, blah blah blah.\r\n&quot;I need to say about this article, I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s true or false,&quot; she went on. &quot;All I&apos;m talking about is what my intuition is saying. The background story is I had never met this babysitter.&quot; (Us Weekly reported Jon and Santoro -- who sold $2 shots at local bar Legends Lounge -- had a sexy sleepover in early August.)\r\nIn August, cops were called to the the family&apos;s $1.1-million Pennsylvania home after Kate showed up while Jon was supposed to have custody of their eight kids.\r\nKate explained: &quot;I learned that he asked this babysitter to come over when he was not going to be home. It started out very friendly. I called him and said, &apos;If you&apos;re not going to be home, can I come?&apos;&quot;\r\nCheck out pictures from Jon and Kate&apos;s summer\r\nKate says her &quot;alarms and whistles&quot; were going off about Santoro. &quot;I asked him kindly to use the approved babysitters we have,&quot; she said.\r\nKate said she &quot;sat at the gate and just sobbed.&quot;\r\nJoy Behar pointed out that Kate was &quot;winning the PR award.&quot;\r\nSaid Kate: I&apos;m not out to win any awards.

I don&apos;t know,&quot; he continues. &quot;People die from various and sundry causes - they have congenital malformations of the heart, they have difficulty with various infections. I don&apos;t know what Michael Jackson&apos;s death is a result of.&quot;\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nOxmon says the 50-year-old Jackson -- who suffered cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. PST Thursday -- &quot;had no particular health concerns except that he had broken his leg many years ago, and it hurt him.&quot;\n&quot;He had cracked a vertebrae in his back and he took painkillers to try to ease the pain,&quot; he says. &quot;And now we find ourselves here. I don&apos;t know if the two are connected. I had warned that the misuse of medications would result in this, and I am heartbroken that we are here.&quot;\nThough some reports claim Jackson may have overdosed on Demerol, Oxmon declined to elaborate on the types of medications Jackson was taking &quot;because it is something which is private to Michael, and we&apos;ll have to wait for the toxicology reports before we jump to any kind of conclusions. I only know that I warned that his day may come. And lo and behold, here we are.&quot;\nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\nAn autopsy is planned for Friday, but results may not be final until toxicology tests can be completed, which could take several days and sometimes weeks. Los Angeles County Coroner Investigator Jerry McKibben said if a cause can be determined by the autopsy, they will announce the results.\n&quot;We will have to wait to see what the toxicology reports have to say, what the coroners report has to say,&quot; Oxmon says. &quot;When that happens, I will be very vocal. It could very well be he died from natural causes, in which case, my gosh, the tragedy becomes even greater.&quot;  \nSee today&apos;s top celeb news pics\nJackson was set to headline 50 sold-out shows, billed &quot;This Is It,&quot; at London&apos;s O2 Arena beginning in July -- his final London performances.  Oxman did not know if Jackson had been examined before the tour, but &quot;he has been in good health,&quot; he says.\nAs he rehearsed for the concerts, &quot;He had been making his very best efforts to be pain-free, but it&apos;s been very difficult to him,&quot; Oxmon says.\n&quot;But I was not aware, and I don&apos;t think any of the family members were aware, of any kind of specific condition which was causing him any kind of medical or physical difficulty,&quot; he continues. &quot;I don&apos;t know what the extent of his exercise routine was.

In fact, quite the opposite.  In the February issue of Harper&apos;s Bazaar (out January 16), she advises couples not to take their love life too seriously. &apos;Don&apos;t take love and your relationship so g-ddamned heavy all the time,&quot; says the free-spirited actress. &quot;Laugh, laugh, laugh!&quot;\r\nMore highlights from Drew&apos;s Harper&apos;s interview below:\r\nOn how to live life:&#xA0;&quot;You know, it&apos;s all just humor. Don&apos;t take life too seriously. Don&apos;t take fashion too seriously. Don&apos;t take the movie industry too seriously... Life is high school and it&apos;s small and everybody talks about everybody, so just laugh your ass off.&quot;\r\nOn working with Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics:&#xA0;&quot;Hugh makes me laugh so hard. He&apos;s such an odd bird, and I love him so much for it.&quot;&#xA0;\r\nOn wanting to work with Sacha Baron Cohen of Borat:&#xA0;&quot;I like smart, weird, funny and sharp. The guys I had crushes on growing up were Ted Koppel and David Letterman.&quot;\r\nOn her relationship with Moretti:&#xA0;&quot;You need to reinvent your relationship if you want to continue being together.  Right now I&apos;m in a phase of, I&apos;m not even your girlfriend. I&apos;m your best friend who is madly in love with you. I&apos;m really interested in watching him right now. The longest I&apos;ve ever been with someone was like two to three years, so I&apos;m in uncharted waters. Right now I&apos;m more into championing him as a human being than gushing love for him.&quot;&#xA0;\r\nOn starring in fashion designer Giles Deacon&apos;s ad campaign:&#xA0;&quot;I honestly can&apos;t believe anyone would ever hire me.  I am like the girl on the couch who eats the Chinese food.  I don&apos;t have the body type. I don&apos;t have the daily stylishness. I can&apos;t believe they&apos;re letting a funny jester like me get involved in fashion.&quot;\r\nOn her style:&#xA0;&quot;What I&apos;m nuts for is sensible real clothes. Whenever you know, John Galliano [a close friend] gives me a dress to wear, I feel like Cinderella.&quot;&#xA0;\r\nOn her body:&#xA0;&quot;I am constantly battling my weight. I want to eat whatever I want and get away with it, but I can&apos;t. I want to wear whatever I want, but I can&apos;t.&quot;\r\nOn advice for Lindsay Lohan:&#xA0;&quot;I know Lindsay, and I like her very much... You just have to try to be as graceful as you can. You know, you flub, you flub. And that&apos;s life... I think, do what you want, but just be professional.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id":

George told reporters during a press conference Thursday.\n&quot;As many of you know, my belief is that the pending custody proceedings are the most private and the most sensitive of matters as they impact the lives and the fates of young children. To that end, I&apos;ve endeavored out of respect for Michael&apos;s children and family, especially in this time of grieving, to keep silence on these matters, to deny all interview requests and to share only that information involving upcoming public court proceedings.&quot;\nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years\nEarlier Thursday, NBCLA&apos;s Chuck Henry reported that he has spoken to Rowe - mother of Prince, 12, and Paris, 11 - and she told him, &quot;I want my children.&quot;\nAlthough Rowe herself has not spoken publicly about the custody proceedings, George said, &quot;I have no reason to doubt that what was reported from that conversation was accurately and ethically reported, but that said, it would be a distortion of the truth to allow that single snapshot of a single conversation, to stand as the truth on Debbie&apos;s position on this sensitive matter.&quot;  \nRevisit Michael Jackson&apos;s most unforgettable moments\n&quot;Once again, the truth is that Debbie has not reached a final decision concerning the pending custody proceedings,&quot; he concluded. &quot;When Debbie does take a position in the public forum of a court, those positions will, of course, be conveyed to all interested persons.  In the meantime, I very much appreciate everybody&apos;s continued respect for Debbie&apos;s privacy at this time, and I&apos;m very sorry, but I cannot address any questions at this time.&quot;  \nSee photos of Michael Jackson and his kids through the years\nIn Jackson&apos;s will (released Wednesday) the singer - who died at age 50 after suffering cardiac arrest June 25 -- named his mother Katherine as guardian of his three children -- Prince, Paris and 7-year-old Blanket. (If Katherine died before him or couldn&apos;t serve as guardian, Jackson nominated Diana Ross, according to Jackson&apos;s will.)\nHe &quot;intentionally&quot; omitted Rowe from his will, he said.  \nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nLast week, Katherine filed a petition in Los Angeles Probate Court seeking legal guardianship of the children. (In her 22-page petition, she claims the children &quot;have no relationship with their biological mother.&quot;)\nA guardianship hearing scheduled for Monday has been postponed until July 13 at the request of attorneys for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.\nRowe wed Jackson in 1996 (he was a patient in the dermatologist&apos;s office, where she worked as a nurse). The children were born through artificial insemination. (The new issue of Us Weekly exclusively reports that the children&apos;s father is Arnold Klein, Jackson&apos;s L.A.-based dermatologist and Rowe&apos;s former boss.)\nAfter Jackson and Rowe divorced in 1999, she agreed to give up her parental rights, insisting Jackson was a good father.\nSince their father&apos;s passing, the kids have been with the Jackson family and &quot;are happy,&quot; Jackson patriarch Joe said at a press conference Monday. They&apos;re with &quot;other young ones in the Jackson family.... They were never around other kids.&quot;\nA source tells Us the Jacksons have not yet reached out to Rowe.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/attorney-debbie-rowe-has-not-reached-a-final-decision-about-custody-200927/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Debbie Rowe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/debbie-rowe/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Diana Ross", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/diana-ross/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/attorney-debbie-rowe-has-not-reached-a-final-decision-about-custody-200927/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/attorney-debbie-rowe-has-not-reached-a-final-decision-about-custody-200927/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Attorney: Debbie Rowe &#8220;Has Not Reached a Final Decision&#8221;

It just happened to fall on Kate&apos;s birthday.&quot;\nCheck out photos of Jon and his mistress.\nNot shown on camera: Deanna Hummel, the 23-year-old teacher with whom Jon had a three-month affair. A source confirmed to Us Weekly they were together at a Spring Gruv party at The Canyon in Utah on Kate&apos;s March 28 birthday.  Back home in Pennsylvania, the kids surprised Kate with a trip to Charm City Cakes, which is featured on the Food Network show Ace of Cakes.\nSee adorable photos of the Gosselin kids.\nKate -- who works out with a personal trainer to maintain her post-tummy tuck bikini bod -- chowed down on lemon birthday cake.  &quot;I never eat this stuff!&quot; she says.  Jon and Kate also recorded a few of their couch testimonials together this episode -- different than the gloomy scenes shot separately in the premiere.\nCheck out photos of stars caught cheating.\n&quot;This season, sometimes you&apos;ll see Kate and I interview separately. Sometimes you&apos;ll see us interview together on the chair,&quot; Jon explains in a voice-over played in the second episode, shown back-to-back after the first. &quot;It depends how things are going. We have busy schedules. And that&apos;s it.&quot;  (Noticeably though, the couple only appear in the same town while taping testimonials -- never in the episodes. On last week&apos;s premiere, Kate said they may split.)  During the second 30-minute show, Kate takes twin Maddy on a trip to San Diego. Their plans?  &quot;Shopping, sun, sand, spa, swimming, Sea World, sushi, Shamu!&quot; the 8 year old ticks off. (She&apos;s also spotted handing her mom her BlackBerry later on.)\nSee what stars look like with Kate Gosselin&apos;s hair.\n Back on the grounds of their $1.1-million Pennsylvania home, one of the sextuplets, Alexis, trips and accidentally bites through her lip. (She isn&apos;t seriously hurt.)  &quot;I was on the elliptical and got a phone call,&quot; Kate says.    &quot;We usually don&apos;t call,&quot; Jon says, as Kate interrupts, &quot;No news is good news.&quot;  After last week&apos;s premiere earned 9.8 million viewers (a record for the network), TLC announced they had ordered a 40-episode season.\nSee pics of reality show love that didn&apos;t work out.\n On Friday, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor confirmed that an investigation is underway to determine if Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 is violating child labor laws after receiving a complaint against the show.

She put together these big centerpieces that were lush with flowers and greenery, including tangerine orchids, curly willow branches and cherry love roses. They were simply gorgeous. She also designed a bridal bouquet for me and as soon as she handed it to me, I never wanted to put it down! It was beautiful!\r\nShe also set up a more contemporary set of flowers for her vision as to how our cocktail room should look like. We absolutely fell in love with it! (The whole look costs $28,000.) She also laid out several linens on round tables and paired them with a variety of chairs. I always liked chiavari chairs, but would never expect to have them at our reception because they typically cost so much money. But she showed us so many other chair options that I never even knew existed!\r\nI am really excited to see how the reception venue will look once its all put together. I am totally blown away by the ideas Janet has thought up for us and I cannot wait to share it with our family and friends!

(More than 1.6 million fans registered online for a chance to attend the Staples Center ceremony; only 8,750 names were chosen).  \nSee how Michael Jackson&apos;s face has changed over the years\nWhen asked if Rowe had been in contact with the Jackson family, Schaffel claimed she has attempted to get in touch with the late singer&apos;s family, but has been unsuccessful. (Usmagazine.com reported late last week that the Jacksons have not yet reached out to Rowe.)\n&quot;There has been outreach, unfortunately, like so many cases, there&apos;s so much going on that they just have not been able to make contact,&quot; Schaffel said. &quot;There were several tries, just for the fact of phone numbers that had changed, you know, answering machines that were full.

The children were born through artificial insemination. (The new issue of Us Weekly exclusively reports that the children&apos;s father is Arnold Klein, Jackson&apos;s L.A.-based dermatologist and Rowe&apos;s former boss.)\nAfter Jackson and Rowe divorced in 1999, she agreed to give up her parental rights, insisting Jackson was a good father.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Debbie Rowe", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/debbie-rowe/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Debbie Rowe to Attend Michael Jackson&#8217;s Memorial", "datePublished": "2009-07-06T14:07:57+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:29+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 551, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#respond"]}], "description": "She secured one of the \"VIP seats,\" confirms a former Jackson business associate"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/", "name": "Debbie Rowe to Attend Michael Jackson's Memorial", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-06T14:07:57+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:29+00:00", "description": "She secured one of the \"VIP seats,\" confirms a former Jackson business associate", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Rowe jackson b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/debbie-rowe-to-attend-michael-jacksons-memorial-200967/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Debbie Rowe to Attend Michael Jackson&#8217;s Memorial"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

I&apos;ve had two kids. I&apos;m 33. I don&apos;t look in the mirror and go, &apos;Oh, I look fantastic&apos; Of course I don&apos;t. Nobody is perfect,&quot; Winslet tells the UK Daily Mail. &quot;I just don&apos;t believe in perfection. But I do believe in saying, &apos;This is who I am and look at me not being perfect!&quot; I&apos;m proud of that.&apos;&quot;  Describing her flaws, she jokes, &quot;What&apos;s not perfect about me?

I mean, I go through phases where I think: &apos;Oh, I really should go and do a class.&apos; I don&apos;t have a trainer or a cook.&quot;  Her one diet secret: a pilates DVD, which she works out at home &quot;on the living room carpet,&quot; she says.  &quot;Here&apos;s what&apos;s so great about it: no one&apos;s looking at you, no one&apos;s telling you what to do or work harder or anything like that,&quot; she explains. &quot;I know it seems slightly tragic, but it&apos;s my way of exercising in a time-efficient way.  &quot;I have a mat and little hand weights and I do a stomach thing and a bum thing. It&apos;s very simple - you barely break into a sweat,&quot; she adds.  &quot;My body&apos;s different. It has settled into what it is now. None of this different diets lark. I can&apos;t remember the last time I tried some new fad.&quot;  She continues: &quot;Honestly I eat anything, although the only thing I don&apos;t is pasta, because it gives me a stomach ache.&quot;\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Winslet, who is married to director Sam Mendes also opened up about giving her children a normal upbringing.  &quot;I cook at home. I have a cleaner and a baby-sitter, but my mantra is &apos;Keep it simple,&apos;&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t want staff running around. I want them to put their own dirty clothes in the laundry bin and bring their plates from the table to the sink.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Winslet", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-winslet/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Kate Winslet: I&#8217;m Not Into Fad Diets", "datePublished": "2008-11-14T16:57:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:21+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 540, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#respond"]}], "description": "\"I don't look in the mirror and go, 'Oh, I look fantastic,'\" she admits"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/", "name": "Kate Winslet: I'm Not Into Fad Diets", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2008-11-14T16:57:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:21+00:00", "description": "\"I don't look in the mirror and go, 'Oh, I look fantastic,'\" she admits", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Kate Winslet arrives at the Cardboard Citizens dinner and charity auction on February 15, 2008 in London, England.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-winslet-im-not-into-fad-diets-20081411/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Kate Winslet: I&#8217;m Not Into Fad Diets"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

I just agree.  She added, &quot;You don&apos;t know as much as you know in your 20s as you do in your 30s as you do when you are...&quot;    &quot;I&apos;m startin&apos; to live,&quot; she added. &quot;It&apos;s good!&quot;\r\n\r\nAsked about her nearly naked January GQ cover, Aniston remarked, &quot;It&apos;s funny. I mean, I honestly see it as a different person. It&apos;s just -- well, because the headlines are just outrageous, so you usually get a kick out of that. But you just kind of go -- you try to walk past it as fast as you possibly can, honestly.&quot;\r\n\r\nAlthough she recently complained that her personal life is &quot;none of people&apos;s &quot;(expletive) business,&quot; she said she doesn&apos;t mind people gawking at her.  Said the star, &quot;It&apos;s amazing how you can sort of start to tune them out.&quot;  \r\n\r\nAs for her new movie Marley &amp; Me (out Dec. 25), she said it was &quot;so nice&quot; not starring in &quot;your normal romantic comedy, where it&apos;s about getting the guy or getting the girl.  &quot;At the end when they walk off into the sunset ... you get to actually tell the story,&quot; she said of the doggy drama.  Aniston added that she and co-star Owen Wilson &quot;had a great time.\r\n\r\n&quot;It was easy from the minute we met. We just had ... very similar sensibilities,&quot; she explained. &quot;He&apos;s just so good.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Aniston", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jennifer-aniston/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Mayer", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/john-mayer/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Owen Wilson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/owen-wilson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jennifer Aniston: &#8220;I&#8217;m Starting to Live&#8221;", "datePublished": "2008-12-19T16:57:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:22+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 455, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#respond"]}], "description": "\"You don't know as much as you know in your 20s as you do in your 30s,\" she says on CBS' Early Show"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/", "name": "Jennifer Aniston: \"I'm Starting to Live\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2008-12-19T16:57:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T01:59:22+00:00", "description": "\"You don't know as much as you know in your 20s as you do in your 30s,\" she says on CBS' Early Show", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Jennifer Aniston arrives at the Los Angeles Premiere \"Marley & Me\" at the Mann Villager Theater on December 11, 2008 in Westwood, CA.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-aniston-im-starting-to-live-20081912/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Jennifer Aniston: &#8220;I&#8217;m Starting to Live&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

It&apos;s not funny.&quot;  \nCheck out photos of the Palin family on the campaign trail\nOn his show earlier this week, Letterman joked that Palin&apos;s daughter got &quot;knocked up&quot; by Alex Rodriguez during their recent trip to New York&apos;s Yankee Stadium. He later clarified that the crack was aimed at Palin&apos;s 18-year-old daughter Bristol, even though it was her 14-year-old daughter, Willow, who had been at the ball game.  \nFind out which other stars were teen moms\nDespite Letterman&apos;s clarification, Palin wasn&apos;t happy, calling it &quot;a degrading comment about a young woman.&quot;  &quot;No wonder young girls especially have such low self-esteem in America when we think it&apos;s funny for a so-called comedian to get away with such a remark as he did,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t think that&apos;s acceptable.&quot;  \nSee pics of more star scandals\nPalin also said there was a double standard where the media treats President Barack Obama&apos;s family as generally off-limits while her family has been publicly ridiculed.  She also denied that it was also in bad taste for her spokeswoman, Meghan Stapleton, to say that Palin would not appear on Letterman&apos;s show because &quot;it would be wise to keep Willow away from David Letterman.&quot;\n&quot;Maybe he couldn&apos;t be trusted because Willow has had enough of this type of comments and maybe Willow would want to react to him in a way that maybe would catch him off-guard,&quot; Palin said. &quot;That&apos;s one way to interpret such a comment.&quot;\nOn his show Thursday, Letterman kept the Palin jokes alive.  He told the audience that &quot;everything&apos;s fine now&quot; between him and Palin, then adding that the Alaska Gov. called and invited him to go hunting.  &quot;I&apos;m Dave Letterman,&quot; he said, &quot;making friends wherever I go.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id":

By Aug. 28 -- after a week of rehearsal -- she dropped another five pounds, she says. &quot;I just noticed a difference!&quot; she tells Us. \r\nSee before and after photos of stars&apos; amazing DWTS body makeovers \r\nPrepping for DWTS is &quot;like boot camp almost,&quot; she says. &quot;You have to get your rest, eat properly, rest, focus...it&apos;s challenging.&quot;  Mya became a vegetarian two months ago &quot;to get lighter,&quot; she says, but she doesn&apos;t deprive herself now that she&apos;s dancing up to five hours a day. &quot;My weight may change after I stuff my face!&quot; she jokes. &quot;My weakness is the pasta and the rice!&quot;  \r\nBesides focusing on her diet, she&apos;s also trying to avoid injury. Last year, Jewel and Nancy O&apos;Dell had to pull out of the show after being seriously injured, and now producers are only letting couples practice five hours per day. \r\n &quot;It&apos;s my first fear and concern because I had a foot fracture earlier this year. This is my first introduction into being able to be physical,&quot; she says. &quot;I try to rehearse in flats, and then put on heels to see how it feels.&quot;  So far, her foot seems fine, but she&apos;s struggling with &quot;blisters and bruises&quot; she admits.   &quot;I think my whole body has been in pain! I can&apos;t really tell if it&apos;s just my foot because I&apos;m breaking it in. Honestly, it&apos;s just soreness,&quot; Mya tells Us.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 423}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Mya", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/mya/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Mya: I&#8217;ve Lost 11 Pounds While Training for DWTS", "datePublished": "2009-08-31T18:41:37+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:58:06+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 347, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity Body"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#respond"]}], "description": "The singer -- who went from 138 pounds to 127 -- says the show is \"like boot camp\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/", "name": "Mya: I've Lost 11 Pounds While Training for DWTS", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-08-31T18:41:37+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:58:06+00:00", "description": "The singer -- who went from 138 pounds to 127 -- says the show is \"like boot camp\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 423, "caption": "1251744097_mya b"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/mya-ive-lost-11-pounds-while-training-for-dwts-2009318/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Mya: I&#8217;ve Lost 11 Pounds While Training for DWTS"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Grigorieva, who is signed to Gibson&apos;s record label, was first photographed with Gibson in 2008 on the set of his movie Edge of Darkness.\r\n\r\nThey made their first public appearance together at a Los Angeles screening of X-Men Origins: Wolverine on April 28 - the same month Gibson and his wife of nearly 30 years (and mother of his seven children), Robyn, filed for divorce.\r\n\r\nDespite intense scrutiny, Grigorieva says her relationship with Gibson has inspired her music. The actor directed four of her music videos.  &quot;If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it&apos;s pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry,&quot; she says. &quot;So I&apos;ve become very lucky, and I&apos;m very grateful.&quot;  \r\n\r\nAdds Grigorieva, &quot;You don&apos;t control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I&apos;m just doing what I&apos;ve always been doing. It&apos;s not like I&apos;ve changed my goals at all.&quot;  Before beginning press for the new album, Beautiful Heartache, she says Gibson even gave her some advice: &quot;Just be myself and speak the truth.

He was 52 years old.  The singer and impressionist spent more than a decade as one of the most popular performers on the Las Vegas strip.\r\nHe was pronounced dead in his bed shortly after police and paramedics were summoned to his home about 3:45 a.m., according to the Associated Press.  A medical examination was conducted on Friday, but Clark County Coroner Michael Murphy released a statement saying it could take several weeks to receive laboratory results and determine the cause of death.  Gans&apos; manager and longtime friend, Chip Lightman, said Gans was in good health but slept poorly after Wednesday&apos;s show. He took a nap Thursday and stayed in bed through the evening. His wife, Julie, summoned police when she couldn&apos;t rouse him.  &quot;This makes no sense,&quot; said Lightman, adding that Gans watched his diet and didn&apos;t do drugs. &quot;I managed him 18 years, and health was never an issue.&quot;  Gans -- who performed on Broadway and even had a small role in 1988&apos;s Bull Durham -- was mourned by fellow Las Vegas entertainment legends.\r\nSee photos of today&apos;s top celeb news stories.\r\n&quot;We were blessed to be touched by his generous spirit, kind heart and insurmountable talent,&quot; said fellow Vegas legends Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn said in a statement.  Cher, who is currently doing shows at Caesars Palace, was equally upset.  &quot;I was shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden passing of such a unique and gifted talent,&quot; she told Entertainment Tonight.  Added former Vegas performer Celine Dion: &quot;Not only was he the best in his field, but he was such a kind and loving person... I can&apos;t believe he&apos;s not with us anymore, and our heart goes out to his family.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Celine Dion", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/celine-dion/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Cher", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/cher/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Las Vegas Entertainer Danny Gans, 52, Dies", "datePublished": "2009-05-02T14:52:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:49+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 321, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#respond"]}], "description": "The impressionist and singer spent more than a decade on the strip"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/", "name": "Las Vegas Entertainer Danny Gans, 52, Dies", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-05-02T14:52:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:49+00:00", "description": "The impressionist and singer spent more than a decade on the strip", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Danny gans passes b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/las-vegas-entertainer-danny-gans-52-dies-200925/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Las Vegas Entertainer Danny Gans, 52, Dies"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

When asked if the actress was cooperative, she tells Us: &quot;I guess.&quot;  Harding did not release details on where Barton was taken, citing California privacy laws.   But Access Hollywood reports Barton was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold (also known as a 5150) by the Los Angeles Police Department before being transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. (According to the code, authorities can hold a person involuntarily if they present a danger to themselves or others. This same code was used to hold Britney Spears twice in Los Angeles in January 2008.)  In a statement, Barton&apos;s rep Craig Schneider tells Us: &quot;Police were involved due to Ms. Barton&apos;s celebrity status; to ensure her safe transfer to medical treatment for which she remains hospitalized as per the recommendation of her doctor.&quot;\nCheck out the day&apos;s top news photos.\nA source tells Us Barton called the police herself after having a &quot;freak out.&quot;  Barton won&apos;t be at the NYC premiere of her new movie, Homecoming, tonight, an event rep tells Us.   The actress --  best known for her role on The O.C. -- was charged in 2008 with DUI and marijuana possession. She was sentenced to 36 months probation, told to attend alcohol education classes and pay a fine.  Barton checked into rehab after the incident, she said, because &quot;I wanted to prove to the court that I would take it completely seriously.\nSee more pictures of stars in court.\n &quot;I went to rehab to prove I was sober,&quot; continued Barton in an interview with UK Marie Claire.

You can't talk him out of it. Chemical peels and all that stuff.\"\r\n\r\nSee how Michael Jackson's face has changed over the years\r\n\r\n\"I've been around junkies and stuff all my life. I've heard every excuse,\" he says. \"It's like smokers -- 'I only smoke when I drink' and all that stuff. But it's bulls**t. You're justifying something that's destructive to your existence. It's crazy.\"\r\n\r\nRevisit Michael Jackson's most unforgettable moments\r\n\r\nJones says Jackson's obsession with his appearances got to be \"ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chemical peels and all of it. And I don't understand it,\" he says. \"But he obviously didn't want to be black.\" Asked if that is the reason Jackson had undergone so much plastic surgery, Jones says, \"Well, what do you think? You see his kids?\"\r\n\r\nSee photos of Michael Jackson and his kids through the years\r\n\r\nJones isn't sure why Jackson had such a deep-seated issue with the way he looked. (In a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey, The King of Pop said he used to wash his face in the dark because he had pimples. \"I wouldn't want to look in the mirror... and my father teased me,\" Jackson said. \"He would tell me I was ugly.\")\r\n\r\n\"I'm just a musician and a record producer. I'm not a psychiatrist,\" Jones says. \"I don't understand all that stuff. We all got problems. But there's a great book out called Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart. Did you see that? That book says the statute of limitations has expired on all childhood traumas. Get your stuff together and get on with your life, man. Stop whinin' about what's wrong, because everybody's had a rough time, in one way or another.\"\r\n\r\nLook back at Michael Jackson's life\r\n\r\nSo what does he think killed Jackson (who died June 25 at age 50 after suffering cardiac arrest)?\r\n\r\n\"I would think that the pressure of the concerts and the debt and everything else...\" he says. \"...If you sit there and just stay hung up on one negative thought, you will become that thought. I know that Lisa Marie Presley said that she always thought he was going to die like Elvis. You sit and think about that stuff, it'll happen to you. If you start thinking about darkness instead of light, or fear instead of love, you'll get in trouble. I really believe that.\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Quincy-Jones-Michael-Jackson-Didnt-Want-to-Be-Black-.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Oprah Winfrey", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/oprah-winfrey/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Quincy Jones", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/quincy-jones/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Quincy Jones: Michael Jackson &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Want to Be Black&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-07-02T18:20:54+00:00", "dateModified": "2023-07-13T17:11:45+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 545, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Quincy-Jones-Michael-Jackson-Didnt-Want-to-Be-Black-.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=800%2C450&quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#respond"]}], "description": "He says the late singer's obsession with \"chemical peels\" was \"ridiculous\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/", "name": "Quincy Jones: Michael Jackson \"Didn't Want to Be Black\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Quincy-Jones-Michael-Jackson-Didnt-Want-to-Be-Black-.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=800%2C450&quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-07-02T18:20:54+00:00", "dateModified": "2023-07-13T17:11:45+00:00", "description": "He says the late singer's obsession with \"chemical peels\" was \"ridiculous\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Quincy-Jones-Michael-Jackson-Didnt-Want-to-Be-Black-.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Quincy-Jones-Michael-Jackson-Didnt-Want-to-Be-Black-.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675, "caption": "Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/quincy-jones-michael-jackson-didnt-want-to-be-black-200927/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Quincy Jones: Michael Jackson &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Want to Be Black&#8221;"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

He was 50.\nLook back at Michael Jackson&apos;s life\nHe went into cardiac arrest at his Holmby Hills home in L.A. Thursday (a 911 call was placed shortly before 12:30 p.m. PT), according to TMZ, which first reported the news. Paramedics were unable to revive the singer (who had no pulse upon their arrival), the site reports.\nHe was then rushed to UCLA Medical Center while in a deep coma before passing away, The Los Angeles Times reported.  He was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. An autopsy is set for Friday.\nMichael&apos;s father, Joe Jackson, confirmed to E! News his son had a heart attack.  &quot;He is not OK,&quot; he said. &quot;His mother is on her way to the hospital now to check in on him.&quot;   \nSee Us&apos; photo tribute to stars who have died too soon\nAccording to X17, more than 10 members of Michael&apos;s entourage arrived at the hospital just after 1 p.m. PST after following the ambulance.  &quot;They all got out of the SUVs in a panic and Michael was wheeled into the emergency room on a stretcher,&quot; the site reports. &quot;There was definitely a sense of urgency and everyone looked worried.&quot;  TMZ reports that his sister LaToya ran in the hospital sobbing after her brother was pronounced dead.\nSee more of today&apos;s top celeb news photos\nLOOKING BACK\nBorn Aug. 29, 1958, Michael Jackson was the seventh child of the famed Jackson family. He kicked off his career at age 11 as a child star in the band The Jackson 5. While still a member of group, he launched a solo career in 1971.  Jackson went on to win 13 Grammys and boast 13 number one singles. His 1982 album Thriller remains the biggest-selling album of all time, with more than 26 million copies.\nSaid Neil Portnow, of the Recording Academy: &quot;Rarely has the world received a gift with the magnitude of artistry, talent, and vision as Michael Jackson. He was a true musical icon whose identifiable voice, innovative dance moves, stunning musical versatility, and sheer star power carried him from childhood to worldwide acclaim. A 13-time GRAMMY recipient, Michael&apos;s career transcends musical and cultural genres and his contributions will always keep him in our hearts and memories. We are deeply saddened by this tragic news and our hearts go out to his family and to music lovers around the globe who mourn this great loss.&quot;\nJackson wasn&apos;t only known for his signing: He inspired countless artists  with his dance move known as the moonwalk. (However, he also outraged some with his crotch-grabbing dance moves.)\nDespite the professional success, he has drawn much criticism for his wacky personal life.   His physical features changed drastically: His skin became lighter and his nose narrower.  Jackson - who often wore a germ mask and kept a pet chimpanzee named Bubbles - also palled around with children at his Neverland ranch. In 2005, he was cleared of charges he molested a 13-year-old cancer survivor at Neverland in 2003.\nIn August 1994, Jackson wed Lisa Marie Presley but divorced in 1996. He went on to wed Debbie Rowe, a nurse. Two children were born through artificial insemination: Prince Michael Jackson, in 1997, and Paris Michael Jackson, in 1998. He also had a third child, Prince Michael Jackson II.\nJackson was set to headline 50 sold-out shows at London&apos;s O2 Arena beginning in July, billed &quot;This Is It&quot; -- his final London performances.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Jackson", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/michael-jackson/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Michael Jackson, the King of Pop, Dies at Age 50", "datePublished": "2009-06-26T00:22:32+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:06+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 600, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#respond"]}], "description": "Paramedics were unable to revive him after he went into cardiac arrest Thursday"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/", "name": "Michael Jackson, the King of Pop, Dies at Age 50", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-26T00:22:32+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:56:06+00:00", "description": "Paramedics were unable to revive him after he went into cardiac arrest Thursday", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michael-jackson-the-king-of-pop-dies-at-age-50-2009256/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Michael Jackson departs the Santa Barbara Superior Court in Santa Maria, California following the end of the 58th day of Jackson's child molestation trial.

I know my audience, so it was really a thank you to them.&quot;  Osmond is brushing off any negativity.  &quot;I think it shows how far I&apos;ve come over the 10 weeks,&quot; she said. &quot;There&apos;s no way I could&apos;ve done that 10 weeks ago!  &quot;It would&apos;ve been nice to [hear], &apos;You&apos;re all ...

The Gosselins recently spent two weeks apart: Kate vacationed with the kids and Neild in North Carolina, while Jon was spotted hanging with two female family friends in New York and New Jersey.\nSee pictures of Jon with his former girlfriend.\nThey reunited this past week. Kate was spotted taking her kids on coffee runs  to Starbucks, and Jon rode his four-wheeler on their sprawling property.\nFor more on Jon&apos;s seedy behavior - including how he spent Valentine&apos;s Day buying shots for girls, TLC&apos;s staged &quot;romantic&quot; getaway that got canceled last minute because of Jon&apos;s affair, and Jon&apos;s appalling treatment of a babysitter - pick up the new Us Weekly today!", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kate-gosselin-annoversary.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kate Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kate-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Kate Spends 10th Wedding Anniversary With Kids", "datePublished": "2009-06-12T20:32:52+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-10-29T17:08:51+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 310, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kate-gosselin-annoversary.jpg?w=800&h=450&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#respond"]}], "description": "With Jon nowhere in sight, TLC cameras roll outside their $1.1 million estate"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/", "name": "Kate Spends 10th Wedding Anniversary With Kids", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kate-gosselin-annoversary.jpg?w=800&h=450&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-06-12T20:32:52+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-10-29T17:08:51+00:00", "description": "With Jon nowhere in sight, TLC cameras roll outside their $1.1 million estate", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kate-gosselin-annoversary.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kate-gosselin-annoversary.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Kate Gosselin at home in Reading, Pennsylvania on Kate and Jon's 10th wedding anniversary on June 12, 2009.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-spends-10th-wedding-anniversary-with-kids-2009126/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Kate Spends 10th Wedding Anniversary With Kids"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

And she&apos;s great so she&apos;s going to be good at whatever she does.&quot;\nCheck out Paula Abdul&apos;s wacky wardrobe.\nPosh Spice, 35 -- who will appear in one episode of Season 9 -- said she couldn&apos;t turn down the opportunity, which came one day after Abdul announced she wasn&apos;t returning.\n&quot;I am beyond excited!&quot; Beckham said. &quot;When I got the phone call, I just couldn&apos;t believe it.

But at the same time, there&apos;s nothing wrong with a little bit of constructive criticism. It&apos;s doing it nicely, because even those that are bad, they don&apos;t know that they&apos;re bad and who am I to shatter that?&quot;  \nSee photos of Idol&apos;s most memorable contestants.\nShe is also anxious to sit alongside Simon Cowell.  &quot;He is the only man in the music industry who turned down the Spice Girls and said, &apos;We would never work,&apos;&quot; she revealed. &quot;But I have so much respect for him... I like the fact that he&apos;s honest. I think he&apos;s very funny. He has a very tongue-in-cheek British sense of humor, which I have to, so I&apos;m looking forward to a little bit of banter. I hope he does give me a little bit of a hard time.

Nearly 2,000 miles away, promoting her book Eight Little Faces in Bellevue, Washington.  While TLC had no comment on the story or the couple&apos;s marital status, Jon sent an emailed statement to Us.  &quot;I went to Legends to speak to the owner. A friend of mine wanted to check out my car, so I let her drive it to her car,&quot; he says. &quot;Yes, I have female friends -- but that is all she is. I&apos;m not going to end my friendships just because I&apos;m on TV.&quot;  \nCheck out the day&apos;s top news photos.\n In February, the 32-year-old was spotted flirting with -- and even attempting to kiss -- coeds at Juniata College, multiple students confirm to Us Weekly. (He denied any wrongdoing.) He told one coed &quot;he was getting divorced.&quot; In the May Ladies Home Journal, he says, &quot;I always thought I would be, like, 54 years old and marry a 19-year-old or something.&quot;  \nSee the most expensive star splits.\nFor more details on Jon&apos;s bizarre late nights out away from his family, why neighbors in town believe they may have split, how he &quot;hates&quot;

They all took care of each other, and I think that&apos;s the way it should be.&quot;  Asked if she&apos;s coming back, Zarin told Us, &quot;You&apos;ll have to watch and see what happens.

Lambert was angry when he learned that the label teamed up with Hi Fi Recordings to release an 11-track album, On With the Show, featuring his early works later this summer.\n&quot;The work I did back then in no way reflects the music I am currently in the studio working on,&quot; Idol producer 19 Entertainment said in a statement this week on behalf of Lambert.\nFind out where your favorite Idol contestants are now\nBut a Hi Fi Recordings rep tells Usmagazine.com exclusively:  &quot;Adam is now enjoying the success that he and Wilshire Records hoped for. However, he is now represented by high-profile companies who released a statement in Adam&apos;s name saying the songs on On With the Show were recorded four years ago and Adam only contributed vocals. This is simply not true.\n&quot;The songs were recorded in a professional recording studio with top notch musicians and producers since the music was always meant to be released. Of the 11 songs that will appear on the album, On With the Show, Adam co-wrote eight with Monte Pittman (Madonna&apos;s guitar player).  \nSee photos of more sexy singers at the CMT Awards this month\n&quot;As co-writer and performer, Adam will receive significant royalties just as any superstar artist would. He has the chance, finally, to make a fortune for his work -- definitely more with this album than through a major label deal.\n&quot;This pre-Idol work is a fantastic representation of who Adam is and what inspired him during the months before he became famous. We intend to see that Adam will still benefit from the success of &apos;Want&apos; (on iTunes now), and from the sale of On With the Show, even though he is now part of a major franchise that only wants fans to hear the music Adam records for them,&quot;

As I grew up and started having boyfriends, I would share with him, and he was like a little kid who talked about the bases- what first base was, what second base was, and it sounded very odd to the outside, I can imagine, but to the inside, to someone who&apos;s never really left his bubble, you can understand how he would be curious.&quot; Shields continues.\r\nSee photos of Michael Jackson with his kids.\r\n&quot;There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, &apos;You have me for the rest of your life, you don&apos;t need to marry me, I&apos;m going to go on and do my own life and have my own marriage and my own kids, and you&apos;ll always have me.&apos; I think it made him relax.

According to Tanczos, Jon just wanted to come in &quot;to have a beer and chill.&quot; He was standing around talking to the women -- one was middle-aged and one who looked to be in her 20s or 30s -- when he noticed a few people taking photos. He turned his back to the cameras.   &quot;People weren&apos;t causing a scene or ooohing and ahhhing, but Jon could tell people were starting to notice him and he got uncomfortable,&quot; Tanczos says.\r\n\r\nJon, who only stayed at the bar for 30 minutes that afternoon, finished his first beer and left, Tanczos tells Us.  A woman named Jess called into 104.7 The Dial radio station after spotting Jon at the Front Street tiki bar.  &quot;They were just ... drinking some Miller Lites,&quot; Jess said on the air. &quot;No canoodaling, nothing like that.

Black Eyed Peas&apos; will.i.am was among the guests. (Around 5:09 p.m., attendees were overheard saying that the two had wed; cheers were also heard outside the estate.)\n&quot;It&apos;s official! Fergie and Josh tied the knot tonight in Malibu,&quot; her manager tells Us. &quot;The Black Eyed Peas were all there. The ceremony was incredible! And they&apos;re still partying!&quot;\nLook back at Fergie&apos;s weight ups and downs leading up to her wedding.\nFergie, 33, wore a fitted, white ruched, corseted wedding gown with a mesh tulle overlay, spaghetti straps and a long train designed by Dolce &amp; Gabbana. The singer was draped in millions of dollars worth of one-of-a-kind diamonds by H.Stern.  Duhamel, 36, also wore Dolce &amp; Gabbana, as did the bridesmaids (in black dresses) and groomsmen (in black suits and white ties).  The two exchanged H.Stern rings, with each band engraved with special personal messages by the bride and groom. Her engagement ring had a round, 4-carat brilliant cut diamond set amid other diamonds, with colors ranging from white to cognac. A narrow colored diamond wedding band was designed to match. Duhamel&apos;s ring was made of 18K white gold with a brush finish.\nSee unforgettable celeb wedding photos.\nThe singer (real name: Stacy Ferguson), and Duhamel have been dating since 2004 after Duhamel confessed to In Style that she was his celeb crush.\n&quot;I had read in a magazine that he had a naughty dream about me,&quot; Fergie told Playboy last year. &quot;All my friends knew about him because he had been a soap opera star. I&apos;m not into soap operas, but they told me, &apos;You gotta go out with him. Do it for the group. Take one for the team.&apos;\nSee photos of other stars who landed their crushes.\n&quot;Time went by, and I saw on the schedule that we were taping a show called Las Vegas, and I thought, &apos;Is this the show he&apos;s on?&apos;&quot; she went on. &quot;We met, and I said, &apos;I read you had a dream about me.&apos; He said yeah, and I asked, &apos;Was it good?&apos; He said it was. So we hit it off.&quot;\nHe popped the question in late 2007.\nOf wedding plans, Fergie told USA Today, &quot;I have a big stack of wedding magazines, and I&apos;ve never picked one up before in my life.&quot;  \nFind out at what ages your favorite stars got engaged.\nDuhamel recently told Entertainment Tonight that plans were &quot;all going great. It&apos;s fun, actually. We&apos;re both really excited about it, and it will be good.&quot;\nLast month, Fergie told Blender married life won&apos;t be so different for them.\n&quot;We&apos;re practically married, anyway,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m madly in love with him.

A rep for Copperfield tells Usmagazine.com.  &quot;During an illusion where David attempts to walk through the rotating blades of a 12-foot high industrial fan, the fan and its platform were being rotated by one of David&apos;s illusion technicians,&quot; the rep says. &quot;Just prior to David himself walking through the fan, [the assistant] was accidentally pulled into the vortex of the moving fan blades, causing injury to his arm and face.&quot;  The Clark County Fire Department confirms that they received a call at 11:25 p.m. from the theater.  &quot;It was reported that someone&apos;s arm was stuck in a fan prop,&quot; Scott Allison, the fire department&apos;s spokesperson, tells Us.When paramedics arrived, the assistant&apos;s arm was free and had suffered severe bleeding.   The assistant, named Brandon (his last name is withheld for his privacy), broke his arm in multiple places.   &quot;The surgery was several hours wherein the doctors could insert pins and bolts,&quot; the rep says. &quot;There was a puncture on his face requiring eight or nine stitches.  The Copperfield crew waited at the hospital during his arm and face surgery.&quot;\r\nTake a look at reality stars who are cursed.\r\nCopperfield was there when he woke up and presented him with a children&apos;s magic set to practice on during his recovery, his rep says.  &quot;Brandon is a fantastic guy that has been with our team almost a year and is a loyal and hard-working illusion technician that is truly loved by all who know him,&quot; Copperfield tells Us. &quot;If he gets too good with the magic set, I&apos;m in big trouble!&quot;  An eyewitness to the incident tells Us that when it happened, the audience &quot;heard a thump.&quot;  The eyewitness adds: &quot;One of the assistants dropped to the floor. The curtain came down partially. Blood was everywhere, and the other assistants dragged the victim back. Then the curtain closed all the way.&quot;  Shortly after, &quot;Copperfield came out and said, &apos;We have an emergency and we might have to end the show...please give me two minutes.&apos; He came back a minute later and said, &apos;I&apos;m sorry, the show is over...if you want your money back, refunds will be given,&quot; says the audience member.So You Think You Can Dance judge Mary Murphy -- who happened to be in the audience that night -- calls the moment &quot;shocking.&quot; &#xA0;\r\nCheck out photos of two other famous Davids performing.\r\n&#xA0;\r\n&quot;Everyone around me thought it was a joke; part of the show,&quot; she tells Us. &quot;But from my vantage point I could see clearly how serious it was. I pray that he is all right.&quot;\r\nSee today&apos;s top celeb news photos.\r\nAccording to Copperfield&apos;s rep, Brandon is still in the hospital.  But the show will go on. The hotel source tells Us: &quot;From what I&apos;ve been told, David still intends to do both his shows this evening, as scheduled.&quot;  &quot;The show will go on thanks to David&apos;s amazing, hard-working crew, after rehearsing all day to fill in for Brandon,&quot; Copperfield&apos;s rep says. &quot;Many people assume that the death-defying illusions I do on stage are not dangerous,&quot; Copperfield tells Us. &quot;This unfortunate accident shows that couldn&apos;t be further from the truth, and we&apos;re just thankful that Brandon&apos;s injuries weren&apos;t worse. An MGM spokesperson had no comment.  Copperfield&apos;s 90-minute show, &quot;An Intimate Evening of Grand Illusion,&quot; is scheduled to run through January.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "David Copperfield", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/david-copperfield/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "David Copperfield Assistant Rushed to Hospital During Las Vegas Show", "datePublished": "2008-12-18T23:18:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:32+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 670, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#respond"]}], "description": "\"Blood was everywhere,\" an eyewitness tells Us of the severe injury that stopped the show"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/", "name": "David Copperfield Assistant Rushed to Hospital During Las Vegas Show", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2008-12-18T23:18:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:32+00:00", "description": "\"Blood was everywhere,\" an eyewitness tells Us of the severe injury that stopped the show", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "David Copperfield arrives at the Keep Memory Alive Foundation's 12th annual gala to benefit the Lou Ruvo Alzheimer's Institute at the MGM Grand Conference Center February 9, 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada.", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-copperfield-assistant-rushed-to-hospital-during-las-vegas-show-20081812/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "David Copperfield Assistant Rushed to Hospital During Las Vegas Show"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

They make an estimated $75,000 per episode.)\r\n&quot;I have two houses and eight children to take care of and I need to work,&quot; he told&#xA0;Us.\r\nSee the Gosselin family album.\r\nLater that day, Gosselin taped&#xA0;Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8&#xA0;with the kids at the Lower Heidelberg Fire Company in Berks County, Pa. The family threw a fundraising lemonade stand.\r\nGosselin smiled and posed with local young women while wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with &quot;Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies&quot; and big sunglasses.\r\nSee the many girls of Jon Gosselin.\r\nA witness says the crew filmed the kids for about an hour playing with firemen, who showed off all their equipment.", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 289}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Jon Gosselin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/jon-gosselin/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Jon Gosselin: &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Want&#8221; to Tape Jon &#038; Kate &#8220;Anymore&#8221;", "datePublished": "2009-08-25T14:35:15+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:58:01+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 253, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#respond"]}], "description": "He calls his current life a \"nightmare\" and laments he has to pay for his \"two houses and eight children\""}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/", "name": "Jon Gosselin: \"I Don't Want\" to Tape Jon & Kate \"Anymore\"", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-08-25T14:35:15+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:58:01+00:00", "description": "He calls his current life a \"nightmare\" and laments he has to pay for his \"two houses and eight children\"", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jon-gosselin-i-dont-want-to-tape-jon-kate-anymore-2009258/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 290, "height": 289, "caption": "Jon Gosselin with his six youngest children taking part in the 'Lower Heidelburg Volunteer Firefighters Open Day' to help raise money to keep the local station in service.

Fergie (who turned 33) and Tarantino (who turned 45) caught the 7 p.m. performance of Cirque du Soleil&apos;s Beatle-themed show &quot;LOVE.&quot; (They devoured cupcakes backstage, says a source.)

(Guest Kid Rock bought The Dutchess a hot dog toaster called the Hot Diggity Dog. &quot;You put the bun on one side, and you put the hot dog in the little hot dog holes, and it pops out of the toaster in about a minute, and your hot dogs are ready to go,&quot; Fergie told Us.)  Further putting those pregnancy rumors to rest, Fergie sipped on wine throughout the night.   At 2:30 a.m. at Jet, Fergie and Tarantino were presented with a birthday cake.

But I believe if you&apos;re on them for an extended period of time, you never get to the problem.\r\n&quot;You never get to see what the problem is, because everything is just kind of OK,&quot; he said. &quot;And so, you don&apos;t deal. And people deal when they get desperate.&quot;  Carrey&apos;s solution: &quot;Supplements,&quot; he said.  &quot;It is vitamins. But it&apos;s also certain elements of the brain like Tyrosine and hydroxytryptophan that they&apos;re treating depression with now,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a natural substance that&apos;s in your brain. Instead of being a Serotonin inhibitor, which just uses the serotonin you have and Prozac and things like that. it just uses the Serotonin you have and it doesn&apos;t allow it go back into the receptor. It metabolizes your serotonin after a while and you have to keep taking more and more to feel good. This actually creates dopamine and creates serotonin,&quot; Carrey continued. &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful thing. It&apos;s amazing. I&apos;m going to talk a lot about it in the near future.&quot;\r\nCarrey said his girlfriend Jenny McCarthy also helps him.  He recalled meeting her years ago at David Spade&apos;s birthday party.\r\n&quot;She looked at me, and she said, &apos;You just looked so peaceful that I had to come and talk to you,&apos;&apos; he told King.  &quot;I mean, I&apos;d seen her a bunch of times, never in person.

Part of the set appears to be made from scaffolding, creating the illusion that she&apos;s dancing on a rooftop with a sky backdrop. She shares the stage with eight male dancers, who wear matching suits and ties.\nSee how Katie Holmes&apos; hair has changed over the years.\nDuring the number, Holmes -- who practiced by lip-syncing to a backing track -- twirls her hair and &quot;seductively shakes her hips,&quot; the witness tells Us. For her finish, Holmes tosses her fedora in the air, and one of the guys catches it. She&apos;s also lifted over three of the dancers&apos; heads at one point. Holmes is being directed by none other than Nigel Lythgoe, the show&apos;s producer and judge. Pal Tyce Diorio choreographed the routine.\nLook back on Katie&apos;s most memorable movie roles.\nOn Monday, Holmes and the dancers practiced for hours, taking few breaks. They called it a night at 6 p.m. The actress -- who also danced during a guest appearance on Eli Stone -- &quot;is killing it,&quot; a source told Us. &quot;She looks incredible.

He added: &quot;After hearing of the malicious allegations, Linda immediately made arrangements to take the test first thing Monday, which was analyzed at LapCorp labs in Florida.&quot;  How did Linda -- whose daughter told celeb blogger Perez Hilton that people &quot;have told&quot; her that her mother does drugs -- fare with the test?\nTake a look at more reality show catfights.\n &quot;Linda Hogan is clean, clean, clean,&quot; Smith said. &quot;She tested negative for everything including Amphetamine (speed), Cannabinoid (marijuana), Cocaine (coke), Opiates (vicodin, morphine, heroin) and Phencyclidine(PCP).&quot;  Still, in the in the new issue of Us Weekly (on newsstands now), Brooke says that although she hasn&apos;t witnessed her mother using, she believes she does.   &quot;I have heard from a lot of close friends -- I mean, a lot of people -- that she does,&quot; the star, 20, told Us. &quot;She has completely changed. She was always hard on me about being a good girl. For her to be so tough on me and then be this crazy-ass wild child... I just don&apos;t know who she ever really was.&quot;  In the statement to Usmagazine.com from Smith, he added:   &quot;Linda also had a full medical exam. According to the doctors who examined her, she has even had gains in bone density and muscle mass since her last physical, which indicates a healthy lifestyle. This further disproves Hulk&apos;s and Brooke&apos;s unfounded and hurtfull allegations. Linda&apos;s drug screening shows she has no trace of any drugs in her system, legal or illegal, that includes prescription medication. Linda does not do drugs and never accused her daughter of doing drugs either.\nHulk is the expert on drug use. He admits in his Rolling Stone article last month about his 30 years of abusing cocaine, marijuana and pills. Now that the truth is in black and white, all Linda wants is an apology from both of them.   &quot;This has been a very vindictive and hurtful attempt to discredit Linda. She has opened her private medical records to disprove Brooke and Hulk&apos;s horrendous, unsupported allegations. She asks the public respect her privacy on this matter so she may begin to repair her relationship with her daughter.&quot;\nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\nBut after Linda -- through her rep -- called her daughter a liar, Brooke told Us that she isn&apos;t sure if she will be able to reconcile their relationship.  &quot;I actually dialed her phone... but she didn&apos;t answer,&quot; Brooke said. &quot;I love her no matter what. I&apos;ll forgive her and I&apos;ll pray for her, but I don&apos;t think I can be around her anymore. Ever. She may as well have disowned me.

Lohan gave the newest issue of Us Weekly a wide-ranging interview over several lengthy phone calls and emails where she was agitated and crying over her recent split from Sam Ronson. Sources told Us they feared she was suicidal.\nSee photos of all of Lindsay&apos;s loves.\nContinues Griffin: &quot;It feels like kicking her when she&apos;s down. Believe it or not, I might kind of take her out for the time being. That&apos;s a little hard to find the comedy in.&quot;  One person she doesn&apos;t mind mocking: Chris Brown, who recently pleaded not guilty to allegedly assaulting Rihanna.  \nLook back at Chris and Rihanna&apos;s happier days.\n &quot;It&apos;s heartbreaking to me...it seems like she&apos;s suffering from classic battered woman syndrome,&quot; says Griffin, who will dedicate a raunchy song to Brown when she hosts Bravo&apos;s A-List Awards on April 15.  The fifth season of D-List premieres this June, and Griffin says &quot;the theme this year is that I&apos;m an A-lister in training. I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve seen the photos of me with Paris Hilton, but I&apos;m a member of young Hollywood now. We&apos;re BFF.&quot;  \nSee photos of stars being funny.\n Hilton was the one who convinced the 48-year-old to slip into a skimpy bikini, she says.   &quot;I wanted to tell you about my new career as a hot bikini model,&quot; Griffin jokes. &quot;I find it&apos;s very difficult to be objectified by Hollywood and be thought of as merely a sex object.  &quot;I remember hearing this hilarious interview with Mischa Barton during the OC, where she said that there was a prejudice against pretty people,&quot; she continues. &quot;Now I know what she was talking about. I feel that there is a prejudice against me because of my hot bikini bod, and you know what? That&apos;s not my fault. Last time I checked, this is America and that isn&apos;t a crime.&quot;", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#webpage"}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "mentions": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Brown", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/chris-brown/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kathy Griffin", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/kathy-griffin/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lindsay Lohan", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/lindsay-lohan/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mischa Barton", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/mischa-barton/"}, {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rihanna", "sameAs": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/rihanna/"}]}, {"@context": "https://schema.org", "@graph": [{"@type": "NewsArticle", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#article", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#webpage"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Us Weekly Staff", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/author/us-weekly-staff/"}, "headline": "Kathy Griffin Lays Off Lindsay Lohan Insults", "datePublished": "2009-04-10T22:46:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:45+00:00", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#webpage"}, "wordCount": 420, "commentCount": 0, "publisher": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#organization"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "articleSection": ["Celebrity News"], "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "CommentAction", "name": "Comment", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#respond"]}], "description": "\"It feels like kicking her when she's down,\" she says of the newly-single actress"}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#webpage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/", "name": "Kathy Griffin Lays Off Lindsay Lohan Insults", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website"}, "primaryImageOfPage": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#primaryimage"}, "image": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#primaryimage"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "datePublished": "2009-04-10T22:46:00+00:00", "dateModified": "2017-12-07T03:54:45+00:00", "description": "\"It feels like kicking her when she's down,\" she says of the newly-single actress", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#primaryimage", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "contentUrl": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "caption": "Griffin lohan b", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kathy-griffin-lays-off-lindsay-lohan-insults-2009104/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://www.usmagazine.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Kathy Griffin Lays Off Lindsay Lohan Insults"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://www.usmagazine.com/#website", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/", "name": "Us Weekly", "description": "Latest Celebrity News, Pictures &amp;

Initially NBC said no, then no again, and after the fourth no, Spencer and Heidi really started to beg and plead to come back.&quot;\nNow that the pair has left Costa Rica for good following Heidi&apos;s weekend hospitalization, Fahey reflects on their time in the jungle with Us -- and previews new cast member Holly Montag&apos;s first episode, airing tonight on NBC.  \nFirst off, what do you make of the various reports that Spencer and Heidi were &quot;tortured&quot; in the Lost Chamber? The reality of this show is that these celebrities are really in the jungle. Spencer and Heidi threw a big fit -- made a lot of people&apos;s lives difficult, left, and then wanted back in. We didn&apos;t think it was fair. They really had to prove [their worth], so they stayed in this old decrepit garden shed with spiders and snakes in tanks and all sorts of bugs, but to be honest, it was probably a more comfortable night&apos;s stay -- physically -- than the rest of the camp. It was more of a mind game.\nWere they given food and water? Heidi and Spencer were given the same amount of rations as the others -- a portion of rice about the size of a small fist -- and water. Food, water, medical attention, they were all taken care of. I think they [just had] a breakdown. They&apos;re not used to living like this. Apparently [now] there&apos;s a lawsuit, and [Spencer&apos;s] going to sue...that just seems like a lot of nonsense.     \nSee the most controversial reality stars of all time! \nTheir return to camp was met with mixed reviews. Were their make-good efforts genuine? Stephen Baldwin said he thought their redemption was genuine and Daniel Baldwin called them &quot;convenient Christians.&quot; I tend to side more with Daniel, though they haven&apos;t done anything to disprove Stephen so far. Seemingly they have found Jesus and I think Spencer&apos;s made an incredible transformation, but it&apos;s a work in progress. I do agree with Daniel, though: if you&apos;re going to be Christian and have all these beliefs, you really have to live your life accordingly, especially when you get preachy.\nSee Heidi and Spencer&apos;s wedding photos. \nHave you heard how Heidi is doing now that she&apos;s received medical attention for a gastric ulcer? As much as they drove me crazy, I obviously hope Heidi&apos;s health is better and that Spencer&apos;s okay, too. I haven&apos;t heard how she&apos;s doing -- we&apos;re focused on the shows at hand -- but you saw on the show how they fasted. They were born-again and they started fasting, and when you&apos;re out in the rain forest in 100-degree heat, it doesn&apos;t matter how much you believe in Jesus, you have to drink water!\nAre they really that religious off-camera? Oh yeah, everything is &quot;Jesus.&quot; I didn&apos;t think a lot of it would make it into the show, just because I know religion is a hot topic. But it did, and it&apos;s &apos;praise Jesus&apos; and this and that. Nothing wrong with that, but it just seemed a little contrived.\nCheck out other religious stars.\nTonight&apos;s episode documents Heidi&apos;s sister Holly&apos;s trip into the jungle. How does she stack up to the competition? She&apos;s the polar opposite of everything we&apos;ve seen with her sister. Very sweet, very nice. She&apos;s in it to win it and that&apos;s a great attitude to have. Some of the cast members were surprised she was taking part -- most didn&apos;t know who she was. I think Stephen Baldwin did a nice job of asking, &quot;Oh, what work do you do?&quot; And she didn&apos;t freak out or be like, &apos;You should know who I am.&apos; Holly doesn&apos;t pretend to be anyone she&apos;s not. And she&apos;s really competitive!\nWhat did she bring for her luxury item?

It seemed to have a history, and the buildings are years and years and years old. Here in the United States an old building is about 17 (years old), and over there it&apos;s from 500 B.C., it&apos;s incredible,&quot; she tells the Associated Press.  &quot;Also, the way people live over there.

In 2006, she stirred controversy for telling a Portuguese paper that she liked &quot;the English lifestyle&quot; because &quot;it&apos;s not as capitalistic as America. People don&apos;t talk about work and money... they talk about interesting things at dinner.&quot; She later said she was misquoted.)  \nSee what Gwyneth Paltrow looked like the first time she walked a red carpet\nPaltrow - who shot the PBS show Spain ... on the Road Again with chef Mario Batali - says she visits Spain at least once a year and remains close to the family she lived with. She calls them &quot;my Spanish mother&quot; and &quot;my brothers.&quot;\nSee who Gwyneth Paltrow and other stars dated in the 90s\nShe also says that she makes sure her children can speak Spanish.\nSays the actress (who took her first trip to Spain as a teen), &quot;Moses speaks  a little bit, but understands everything. Apple speaks a lot.&quot;\nSee stars who need to give their kids haircuts\nPaltrow says she is also writing a book on U.S. cuisine with Spanish influence that is due out next year.  &quot; ... I love food, I love to eat,&quot; she says. &quot;I can&apos;t go on diets.

But dealing with the side effects...not so much.  &quot;I&apos;ve thrown up in almost every limo that has taken me out in the last week,&quot; says Wilkinson -- who is craving grapes and Top Ramen noodle soups. &quot;God, [the drivers] hate me right now.&quot;  \nSee what other star moms craved while pregnant.\n(Although the morning sickness isn&apos;t enough to keep her from having more kids. &quot;We definitely want another kid right away, because we want the two kids to be close in age. We want four, but you know, we are taking it one step at a time.

She was a trooper!&quot;  \nFind out what your favorite fashion models are up to now.\nWinfrey, 55, must have listened to the fashion legend. She was featured on the cover from more than 10 years ago with the tagline: &quot;Oprah! A Major Movie, An Amazing Makeover.&quot;\n&quot;She totally welcomed the idea, and she went on a very stringent diet,&quot; Wintour said. &quot;And it was one of our most successful covers ever.&quot;\nIn the 60 Minutes interview, Wintour, 59, also defended the use of Photoshop to make people &quot;look their best.&quot;\n&quot;That&apos;s one of the things that makes me rather angry, that I don&apos;t understand,&quot; she said. &quot;That if you look wonderful, does that make you less important? Less powerful? Less serious?&quot;\nSee photos of today&apos;s top news stories.\nAlthough Vogue typically only covers stick-thin models within its pages, she said her magazine maintains an awareness of obesity.\n&quot;I&apos;d just been on a trip to Minnesota, where I can only kindly describe most of the people I saw as little houses,&quot; Wintour said. &quot;There&apos;s such an epidemic of obesity in the United States, and for some reason, everybody focuses on anorexia.&quot;\nWintour, who commissioned a feature on the topic complete with illustrations, said that it was an important issue.\n&quot;We need to spend money time and education on teaching people to eat, exercise and take care of themselves in a healthier way,&quot;

Having grown up in New York City, Penney&apos;s was always a favorite stop for me at the mall outside of the city.  I love JC Penney merchandise -- from womens to kids to mens -- and had always found something I wanted when shopping there. This a.n.a. label maxi dress is a perfect example! At just $29.99, it&apos;s similar to a dress I was just admiring on both Angelina Jolie and Heidi Klum. A maxi that&apos;s sexy, in a vibrant color and spot-on for my budget.  \nSee Heidi Klum&apos;s bold fashion sense!\nI really have issue spending loads of cash on spring and summer merchandise, because with the way the climate&apos;s been lately, I have roughly two months to wear these objects of desire before they get packed away for 10 months and that&apos;s that. In the case of this dress though, the color is a not Hawaiian punch bright, so with a little creative styling I can see this work into fall.
