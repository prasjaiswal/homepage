FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/no-bake-pretzel-peanut-butter-bars/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup graham cracker crumbs (about 8 sheets) ($0.38)\n1/2 cup butter ($0.82)\n1 cup peanut butter (+ 2 Tbsp) ($1.38)\n1 cup powdered sugar ($0.07)\n1.5 cups chocolate chips ($1.19)\n25 mini pretzels ($0.10)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. If your graham crackers aren't already in crumb form, use a food processor to blitz them into a fine crumb.\n2. Place the butter and 1 cup of peanut butter in a bowl. Microwave and stir in 30-second intervals, just until they're warm enough to melt together. Stir until evenly combined. (Reserve the last 2 Tbsp peanut butter for later.)\n3. Add the powdered sugar and graham cracker crumbs to the melted peanut butter mixture and stir until evenly combined.\n4. Line an 8\u00d78-inch baking dish with parchment paper making sure some of the paper overhangs on the sides so you can lift the bars out of the dish later. Press the peanut butter mixture into the bottom in an even layer.\n5. Add the chocolate chips and the last 2 Tbsp peanut butter to a bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds, then stir. Continue to microwave and stir in 15 second increments until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth.\n6. Pour the melted chocolate over the peanut butter base in the baking dish and spread it smooth. Add the mini pretzels on top in even rows (I did five rows of five across).\n7.

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/yogurt-banana-bread/ \n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup mashed ripe bananas (about 3 bananas)\n1 cup plain yogurt \n2 large eggs \n1/2 cup sugar \n4 Tbsp butter, melted \n1 tsp vanilla extract \n1.5 cups all-purpose flour \n1 tsp baking powder \n1/2 tsp baking soda \n1/2 tsp salt \n1/4 tsp nutmeg\n1/2 cup chopped walnuts\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF. Rub a little butter on the inside of a loaf pan to coat the bottom and sides.\n2. Mash the banana well, then add it to a large bowl along with the yogurt, eggs, sugar, melted butter, and vanilla. Whisk these ingredients until they're well combined.\n3. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg until well combined.\n4. Pour the dry ingredients into the bowl of wet ingredients and stir together just until there is no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl (a few lumps are okay, just be careful not to over stir). Gently fold in the chopped walnuts.\n5. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, then bake in the preheated 350\u00baF oven for 60 minutes, or until the bread is brown, cracked open on top, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (a few moist crumbs are okay, just no raw batter).\n6. After baking, let the banana bread cool in the pan for about 15 minutes. Once it's slightly cooled it will have pulled away from the bread pan slightly. Run a knife along the sides between the bread and pan, then gently turn the loaf out onto a wire rack to finish cooling. Once cool, slice and serve.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00  Intro\n0:05 Add bananas to a measuring cup and mash well\n0:12 In a bowl add mashed bananas\n0:14 Add yogurt\n0:16 Add sugar\n0:18 Add eggs\n0:20 Add melted butter\n0:22 Add vanilla\n0:24 Mix well\n0:26 In another bowl, add flour\n0:28 Add baking powder\n0:29 Add baking soda\n0:31 Add salt\n0:32 Add nutmeg\n0:35 Mix dry ingredients and wet ingredients together\n0:40 Add walnuts\n0:45 Pour into prepared baking dish\n0:50 Bake at 350 for 60 minutes", "uploadDate": "2020-05-24T19:03:53+00:00", "duration": "PT1M1S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wVhlSWmdhg/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wVhlSWmdhg?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wVhlSWmdhg", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["8", "8 thick slices"], "prepTime": "PT15M", "cookTime": "PT60M", "totalTime": "PT75M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup mashed bananas (ripe, (about 3 bananas) $0.84)", "1 cup plain yogurt ($0.67*)", "2  large eggs ($0.58)", "\u00bd cup granulated sugar ($0.48)", "4 Tbsp butter (melted, $0.40)", "1 tsp vanilla extract ($0.65)", "1\u00bd cups all-purpose flour ($0.27)", "1 tsp baking powder ($0.02)", "\u00bd tsp baking soda ($0.02)", "\u00bd tsp salt ($0.02)", "\u00bc tsp ground nutmeg ($0.02)", "\u00bd cup chopped walnuts ($0.60)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.

Really hearty too, and has that sort of comfort-food quality.\r\n\r\nI accidentally got white sweet potatoes instead of the usual orange ones. They took longer to cook than the sort listed in the recipe, but still tasted fantastic!! So if that's what you've got on hand, they do require some extra time to cook-- Step one was the same, maybe with a bit extra time to get the caramelization you're after (judge by color/crust forming). Added the onions/peppers only, let those sit for about 10 minutes as well (until the onions started getting translucent), and THEN stirred in spices and aromatics and the caned tomatoes and covered still on the medium heat!! That way none of the spices could really singe, and everything had a chance to meld together a little bit in the tomato juices while softening the potatoes. Let that sit on a strong simmer for about 12 minutes until fork-tender.

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/salisbury-steak-with-mushroom-gravy/\n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 yellow onion, divided \n1 lb. ground beef\n1/2 cup breadcrumbs \n1 large egg\n2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, divided\n1 tsp Italian seasoning\n1/2 tsp salt\n1/4 tsp pepper\n1 Tbsp cooking oil\n8 oz. mushrooms\n2 Tbsp butter \n2 Tbsp all-purpose flour \n1.5 cups beef broth*\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Finely mince about \u00bd cup of the onion and slice the remainder of the onion. The minced onion will go in the ground beef mixture, the rest will be used for the gravy.\n2. Add the ground beef, minced onion, breadcrumbs, egg, 1 Tbsp of the Worcestershire sauce (the remainder will go in the gravy), Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until they are evenly combined. Divide the mixture into four equal parts, and shape each into a flattened oval.\n3. Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium. Once the skillet is hot, add the shaped beef patties and cook for about 5 minutes on each side, or until they are well browned on each side. Transfer the cooked patties to a clean plate.\n4. While the beef patties are cooking, slice the mushrooms. After removing the beef from the skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and the remaining sliced onion along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue to cook the mushrooms and onions over medium until they are soft. Allow the moisture released from the onions and mushrooms to help you dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet as you stir.\n5. Once the mushrooms and onions have softened and most of the moisture has evaporated off the bottom of the skillet, add the butter and flour. Continue to stir and cook for about two minutes. The flour and butter will form a paste and begin to coat the bottom of the skillet.\n6. Add the beef broth and one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the skillet. Stir to dissolve the flour into the broth, making sure to dissolve any flour that is stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Allow the broth to come up to simmer (still over medium heat), stirring often. Once it reaches a simmer, it will thicken into a gravy.\n7. Once the gravy is simmering, add the beef patties back to the skillet with the broth, mushrooms, and onions. Spoon the gravy over top, and continue to simmer the beef in the gravy for an additional five minutes. Taste the gravy and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking.\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Intro\n0:10 Slice and mince onion\n0:17 Add onion to ground beef\n0:18 Add breadcrumbs and egg\n0:21 Add worcestershire, italian seasoning, salt and pepper\n0:27 Mix with your hands until combined\n0:32 Divide into four parts and shape into oval patties\n0:36 Slice mushrooms\n0:41 Add oil to pan and cook for five minutes each side\n0:58 Remove patties from the pan and set aside\n1:02 Add mushrooms and onions to pan and saute\n1:10 Add butter and flour to pan\n1:17 Add beef broth to pan and simmer\n1:21 Add worcestershire\n1:25 Add patties back to the pan\n1:32 Spoon sauce over patties\n1:36 Serve", "uploadDate": "2020-05-31T13:11:30+00:00", "duration": "PT1M54S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vYoJxDd198I/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYoJxDd198I?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYoJxDd198I", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT30M", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeIngredient": ["1  yellow onion, divided ($0.32)", "1 lb. ground beef ($5.15)", "1/2 cup breadcrumbs ($0.13)", "1  large egg ($0.23)", "2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, divided ($0.05)", "1 tsp Italian seasoning ($0.10)", "1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)", "1/4 tsp pepper ($0.03)", "1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)", "8 oz. mushrooms ($1.69)", "2 Tbsp butter ($0.26)", "2 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.02)", "1.5 cups beef broth* ($0.20)", "salt and pepper to taste ($0.05)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Finely mince about \u00bd cup of the onion and slice the remainder of the onion.

In a small bowl, combine the spices for the masala spice mix (garam masala, cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper).\n2. Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. Add all three to a large skillet along with the olive oil and saut\u00e9 over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent (about 3 minutes). Add the spice mix and continue to saut\u00e9 for one more minute.\n3. Add the frozen cauliflower florets to the skillet with the aromatics and spices, and continue to saut\u00e9 for about 5 minutes more, or until the cauliflower have thawed through and are completely coated in spices.\n4. Add the drained chickpeas, tomato sauce, and 1/4 cup water to the skillet. Stir to combine, then allow them to simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes. This will help mellow the acidity of the tomato sauce and allow the spices to blend. If the mixture becomes too dry as it simmers, add a couple more tablespoons of water.\n5. After the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Give the masala a taste and add salt as needed. Serve in a bowl either over rice or with a piece of bread for dipping.\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2019-02-23T18:07:56+00:00", "duration": "PT1M3S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQ5ytwxBkWs/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQ5ytwxBkWs?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ5ytwxBkWs", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4", "4 About 1.25 cups each"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT30M", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeIngredient": ["2 Tbsp  garam masala ($0.60)", "1/2 tsp cumin ($0.05)", "1/2 tsp  turmeric ($0.05)", "1/2 tsp  smoked paprika ($0.05)", "1/4 tsp cayenne* ($0.02)", "1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)", "Freshly Cracked Pepper ($0.08)", "1  yellow onion ($0.70)", "3 cloves garlic ($0.12)", "1/2 Tbsp grated fresh ginger ($0.15)", "2 Tbsp  olive oil ($0.44)", "12 oz. frozen cauliflower florets** ($1.28)", "1 15oz. can chickpeas, drained ($0.94)", "1  15oz. can tomato sauce*** ($1.06)", "1/4  cup water ($0.00)", "1/3 cup heavy cream**** ($0.40)", "salt to taste ($0.02)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine the spices for the masala spice mix (garam masala, cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper).", "name": "In a small bowl, combine the spices for the masala spice mix (garam masala, cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper).", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-cauliflower-and-chickpea-masala/#wprm-recipe-40901-step-0-0"}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger.

I ended up using some nice honey garlic sausage from a local market.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kathryn"}, "datePublished": "2022-10-26"}], "recipeCategory": ["Dinner", "Lunch"], "recipeCuisine": ["American"], "keywords": "Roasted SPaghetti Squash, Spaghetti Squash, Stuffed Spaghetti Squash", "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "servingSize": "0.25 squash", "calories": "355 kcal", "carbohydrateContent": "18 g", "proteinContent": "15 g", "fatContent": "26 g", "sodiumContent": "653 mg", "fiberContent": "4 g"}, "@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/sausage-stuffed-spaghetti-squash/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/sausage-stuffed-spaghetti-squash/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/sausage-stuffed-spaghetti-squash/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Budget Bytes", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com", "description": "Delicious Recipes Designed for Small Budgets", "atomUrl": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 71727, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2022-10-15T09:00:00-05:00", "modified": "2025-07-24T05:34:07-05:00", "title": "Sausage Stuffed Spaghetti Squash", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sausage-Stuffed-Spaghetti-Squash-close.jpg", "author": "Monti Carlo", "categories": [{"@id": 12975, "parent": 55, "slug": "comfort-food", "name": "Comfort Food Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10045, "parent": 55, "slug": "cost-per-recipe", "name": "Cost Per Recipe", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12638, "parent": 12636, "slug": "fall-recipes", "name": "Fall Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12636, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 55, "parent": 0, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes", "parents": []}, {"@id": 10051, "parent": 10045, "slug": "recipes-under-10", "name": "Recipes under $10", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 10045, "slug": "cost-per-recipe", "name": "Cost Per Recipe"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10132, "parent": 59, "slug": "sausage", "name": "Sausage Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 59, "slug": "meat", "name": "Meat Recipes"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12636, "parent": 55, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10047, "parent": 10046, "slug": "under-3-per-serving", "name": "Under $3 per serving", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 10046, "slug": "cost-per-serving", "name": "Cost Per Serving"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 5, "parent": 55, "slug": "vegetables", "name": "Vegetable Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}], "tags": ["Italian Sausage", "Mozzarella", "Olive Oil", "Parmesan", "related-player-videos", "Spaghetti Squash"]}]}]

I checked it after an hour on high, and everything was still pretty chunky, so I added about a cup of red wine to loosen things up. After 4 hours, I immersion-blended, added about 3 teaspoons of salt and a bit of extra-virgin olive oil, and all was lovely.  I\u2019ll probably skip the sugar next time - like the butter, I think it\u2019s less necessary with fresh tomatoes than canned.

FULL RECIPE BELOW.\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2015/06/one-pot-roasted-red-pepper-pasta/\n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n 5 cups vegetable broth \n1 lb. Fettuccine \n1 small Vidalia onion \n4 cloves garlic\n1 12 oz. jar roasted red peppers \n1 15 oz. can fire roasted diced tomatoes\n1/2 Tbsp dried basil\n1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional) \nFreshly cracked black pepper \n4 oz. cream cheese (optional) \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Thinly slice the onion and mince the garlic. Remove the red peppers from the liquid in the jar and then slice them into thin strips.\n2. In a large pot, combine the broth, onion, garlic, red pepper slices, diced tomatoes (with juice), basil, crushed red pepper, and some freshly cracked black pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir these ingredients to combine. Break the fettuccine in half, then add it to the pot, attempting to submerge the pieces as much as possible.\n3. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to high. As soon as the pot reaches a full boil, give it a quick stir to loosen any pieces that may have stuck to the bottom, return the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low.\n4. Let the pot simmer on medium low for 10-12 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom. Return the lid as quickly as possible after each stir. After ten minutes, test the pasta to see if it is al dente. Once the pasta is tender, remove it from the heat. (If the pasta becomes too dry before it is tender, simply add a small amount of water and continue to simmer.)\n5. Divide the cream cheese into tablespoon sized pieces, then add them to the pot. Stir the pasta until the cheese melts in and creates a smooth sauce (it will look lumpy at first, just keep stirring). Serve hot.\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\n\n(Sorry 'bout the poor audio quality, folks.

I remember this from my childhood and young adult years, and from the beginning the recipes included pimento, probably for color and during my early years, also green peas--may have been regional. Kudos to this version for no high sodium canned soup! The cream cheese, which I didn't see in early recipes, makes a delicious and velvety sauce. This crockpot version makes cleanup easy. This recipe is easy to divide, and I made a half recipe with only 1/4 tsp salt in my little crockpot that I use for queso.

I love blondies, and have fond memories of eating them in years past. I'm lactose intolerant, so I did a bit of researching how to do brown butter, since my vegan butter substitute, Earth Balance, does not brown on its own (it will get brownish, but it won't get aromatic and nutty like real butter). This may sound strange, but I read you can add a bit of soy sauce (I added about a teaspoon) at the end of the butter melting process, and it adds the extra depth and color. I have to say that the flavor tasted weird in the butter, but once it all baked up, it tasted absolutely delicious. That said, I did not get the texture right. I could tell just in the mixing process that my batter was too stiff, and I'm not sure if that was from cooking the butter too long, overmixing, or what. It did not affect the finished product dramatically at all, but a little denser than I could see the pictures here were.

It holds the same amount as a 9 x 5 inch pan.  2)  Also, after the bread has baked for 30 minutes, I cover the pan with foil and time it for another 15 minutes, then start testing for doneness.

Love the bread, it's not overly sweet, smelled delicious, and was very moist! I used 15oz of pureed squash I had previously roasted and stored in the freezer- this might have had more moisture than canned pumpkin. I added some chocolate chips and baked for about 1 hour. I definitely recommend sticking a knife in to be sure it's not still gooey in the middle. And being sure not to over mix the batter. I might try tenting foil after 40 minutes or so next time because it was just a bit tough on the ends. If you want more sweetness, I'd suggest topping your slice with apple butter or apple sauce!

I dice, freeze on a flat pan for a few hours and then dump into a plastic bag. Typically, the bag collects a few leftover avocados, and when I have enough I generally use the frozen bits for guac, but this is another great idea. I always freeze bananas, too, when they start to get too ripe. Same routine--slice, freeze on a flat surface, and dump into a freezer bag. Another tip--Aldi and Walmart always have inexpensive avocados. I buy smaller ones, both because they are cheap, and the size is most convenient for me.\r\n\r\nI always check this website early in the day--made one of these smoothies this morning, but had no orange juice and used apricot nectar instead. Because of the sweetness of the juice and the bananas, I skipped the agave syrup--which I do like, a lot. Maple syrup or honey would both be good substitutions, but I love the wilder flavor of the agave.

I made it for dinner tonight, following the recipe to a T, and it was SO delicious! My hubby and I loved it. Here are my thoughts and how I served it:\r\n\r\n- I don't have a good blender or a food processor, but I do have an immersion blender and I was able to make the sauce very easily by dicing up the ginger first, and then blending it in the tall plastic measuring cup that came with my hand blender.\r\n\r\n- I used one jalape\u00f1o pepper and thought the chicken was really tasty and well-seasoned. I left the jalape\u00f1o pieces off when I transferred the chicken to the broiler and served it, but I might leave them in next time for a bit more heat, and might add some salt and pepper to the sauce as well.\r\n\r\n- I loved the pieces of onion and will double the amount next time so there's more to enjoy. \r\n\r\n- To serve, I made white rice, sauteed some sliced plantains in butter with a sprinkle of allspice, and mixed up some bagged coleslaw with homemade dressing.

With shrimp at great prices lately, ie $6-8 per lb, I'm thinking about doing this again in very soon with shrimp!\r\n\r\nNo one should be tempted to leave out the anchovies--they are absolutely essential, and if you didn't make the dressing yourself, you would never guess anchovies are in it. I wouldn't touch an anchovy with a 10 ft pole, until I learned how delicious their presence makes a lot of sauces--they melt right in and leave nothing behind but an indescribable hint of taste. I still won't eat one by itself!!! Anchovy paste would work, too--I'm thinking about 1 T?  This is a terrific recipe--thanks so much, Marsha. I really love your simple home style recipes. \r\n\r\nPS--When I open one of those tiny cans, I put the remaining anchovies and oil in a little bag and drop in the freezer. This may not be a recommended thing to do, but I always use them for something delicious in 3-5 weeks. I do the same thing with chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and they don't last long, either. Always use a sharpy to date those bags!!! I also always have hearts of romaine. They are inexpensive and last a couple of weeks in the fridge vs bags of chopped greens that seem to turn to slime in 5-6 days. Another tip--you can always cook those aging greens.

Keep a batch in the freezer for quick weeknight dinners later! \nFULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs, substitutions, and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-meatballs/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs ($0.32)\n1/2 cup grated Parmesan ($0.88)\n1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)\n1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.05)\n1/2 tsp Italian seasoning ($0.05)\n1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)\n1/4 tsp pepper ($0.03)\n2 large eggs ($0.42)\n1/4 cup whole milk ($0.11)\n1 lb. bulk Italian sausage ($3.00)\n1 lb. ground beef ($5.99)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. In a separate small bowl, lightly whisk the two eggs.\n2. Add the breadcrumb mixture, eggs, milk, Italian sausage, and ground beef to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until evenly combined. Avoid over mixing the meat.\n3. Let the meatball mixture rest for five minutes to allow the breadcrumbs time to soften. Divide and shape the meat into about 40 meatballs, approximately 2 Tbsp in volume each.\n\nOVEN COOKING INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place the meatballs on the baking sheet about one inch apart from each other.\n2. Bake the meatballs for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.\n3. Transfer the meatballs to a pot of red sauce and simmer for five more minutes in the sauce. If not using a red sauce, add an additional 3-5 minutes to the bake time, or until the meatballs are cooked through.\n\nSTOVETOP COOKING INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Add a tablespoon of cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium. 2. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the surface of the skillet. Add half of the meatballs to the skillet.\n3. Cook the meatballs, turning every couple of minutes, until browned on all sides and cooked through. Repeat with the second batch of meatballs.\n4. Transfer the cooked meatballs to a pot of red sauce and simmer for a few minutes more before serving.\n\nFREEZING INSTRUCTIONS\n1. You can freeze the meatballs either cooked or uncooked. I prefer freezing them already cooked so they can go straight from the freezer into a pot of red sauce and then just simmer until heated through. Cooked meatballs should be completely cooled before placing in a gallon-sized freezer bag and transferred to the freezer.\n2. To freeze uncooked meatballs, place the raw meatballs on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze on the baking sheet until solid (1-2 hours) before transferring to a gallon-sized freezer bag for longer storage. Thaw completely before cooking.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here. https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:06 Season breadcrumbs\n0:17 Whisk eggs\n0:21 Combine meat, breadcrumbs and eggs\n0:34 Shape meatballs \n0:37 Add meatballs to a baking sheet\n0:40 Bake meatballs\n0:43 Add meatballs to sauce and stir\n0:52 Serve and ENJOY!", "uploadDate": "2022-05-15T15:00:11+00:00", "duration": "PT1M2S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IFc_IuVMXbA/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IFc_IuVMXbA?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFc_IuVMXbA", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["8", "8 about 4 meatballs each"], "prepTime": "PT25M", "cookTime": "PT30M", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeIngredient": ["\u00bd cup plain breadcrumbs (70g, $0.17*)", "\u00bd cup grated Parmesan (50g, $1.92)", "\u00bd tsp garlic powder ($0.05)", "\u00bd tsp onion powder ($0.05)", "\u00bd tsp Italian seasoning ($0.05)", "\u00bc tsp salt ($0.02)", "\u00bc tsp black pepper (freshly cracked, $0.03)", "2 large eggs ($1.58**)", "\u00bc cup whole milk (4 oz., $0.04)", "1 lb. bulk Italian sausage (454g, $3.57***)", "1 lb. ground beef (454g, $4.98)", "1 small yellow onion ($0.70)", "2  garlic cloves ($0.08)", "2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.44)", "2 Tbsp tomato paste ($0.18)", "28 oz. crushed tomatoes (1 can, $1.67)", "\u00bd tsp dried basil ($0.05)", "\u00bd tsp dried oregano ($0.05)", "1 tsp brown sugar (optional, $0.02)", "1 tsp salt (or to taste, $0.03)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.

FULL RECIPE BELOW.\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-rosemary-garlic-white-bean-soup/\n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n- 2 Tbsp olive oil \n- 4 cloves garlic \n- 3 15 oz. cans cannellini beans \n- 2 cups vegetable (or chicken) broth\n- 1/2 tsp dried rosemary \n- 1/4 tsp dried thyme \n- 1 pinch crushed red pepper \n- freshly cracked pepper to taste\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Before you begin, pour one of the cans of cannellini beans (with its liquid) into a blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Drain the other two cans of beans.\n\n2. Mince the garlic and add it to a soup pot with the olive oil. Saut\u00e9 the garlic over medium for about one minute, or just until the garlic is very fragrant.\n\n3. Add the pur\u00e9ed cannellini beans, the other two cans of drained beans, broth, rosemary, thyme, crushed red pepper, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine.\n\n4. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the soup to a boil.

Most who have seen my frequent posts know I can't abide raw onion, so that's one change I made. With no walnuts in my pantry, I used roasted hazelnuts and the resulting salad was really a keeper.

Hearty, filling, and umami-tastic. I had a couple of \u201co ye of little faith\u201d moments while making this recipe, such as when the gravy thickened faster than I expected, just before I added the mushrooms and potatoes, and I was tempted to add some more water/stock to loosen things up a bit. But I followed the recipe exactly as written, and I\u2019m so glad I did! The gravy was perfect - the mushrooms released their liquid, and the gravy became thick but not cludgy.\r\n\r\nOne note, however: when Monti says small dice for the potato, she\u2019s not kidding about the small part! I also found that larger pieces of potato didn\u2019t cook fully, but anything under about 3/4 in. cooked perfectly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rose"}, "datePublished": "2025-02-05"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "reviewBody": "I made this tonight and it turned out great.

I was concerned that they would be too large or not cook properly but they were fine.

The day before (about 18 hours ahead of time) combine the flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. \n2. Stir until well mixed. Add the water, starting with 1.5 cups, and add a little more at a time until the flour forms a cohesive, wet ball. There should not be any dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. The total amount of water you\u2019ll need will vary, but should be between 1.5 to 2 cups. See the photos below for more info.\n3. Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 16-18 hours to ferment.\n4. After 16-18 hours, the dough will look like a large, bubbly mass. Sprinkle with enough flour to be able to scrape it out of the bowl without it sticking to your hands. Place the dough on a well floured surface. Cut the dough into 12 pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball. The dough will be quite wet, floppy, and sticky, so sprinkle liberally with flour as you work.\n5. Place the rolls on a baking sheet covered in foil and lightly sprayed with non-stick spray (I used two baking sheets). Brush the top of each lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle the Italian seasoning over top. Let rise for 30 minutes to one hour or until doubled in size.\n6. While the rolls are still rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Once it is fully preheated, place the rolls in the oven and bake until the surface is a light golden brown (about 25 minutes).

It was amazing! I ate five that day because I couldn't stop myself. Only thing I'm going to change next time from how I made it the second time is to go with 3/4 T salt rather than 1 T salt.

I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. And because I changed up the flour, I used slightly rounded teaspoons of the baking powder to add a little extra. I thought they baked beautifully and taste great!! Oh and because of the almond flour, I sifted all the dry ingredients! They really came out nice and fluffy!

Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder until well combined.\n2. Add 1 cup water to a liquid measuring cup, then add the vanilla extract and vinegar to the water.\n3. Add the oil to the bowl of dry ingredients, followed by the water mixture. Stir until the chocolate cake batter is mostly smooth. Make sure no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl.\n4. Pour the cake batter into an 8x8\" or 9x9\" baking dish. Transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake the cake for 35 minutes.\n\nCHOCOLATE ICING\n1. If using the chocolate icing, let the cake cool for at least an hour after baking before adding the icing.\n2. Wait until the cake is cool, then prepare the icing. Add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract to a bowl. Begin adding water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a thick but pourable icing (about 3 Tbsp total). If you let the icing sit, it may begin to dry, but you can add a splash more water to make it moist again.\n3. Pour the icing over the cooled cake and spread until the cake is evenly covered. Slice the cake into 9 pieces and serve.\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Intro\n0:04 Egg Free Dairy Free Chocolate Cake\n0:10 In a bowl combine flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and cocoa power until well combined\n0:17 Combine water, vinegar and vanilla.\n0:20 Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients\n0:22 Add oil\n0:24 Stir until just combined\n0:27 Pour into prepared pan\n0:30 Bake at 350 for 35 minutes\n0:37 Let cool\n0:38 Prepare frosting\n0:39 In a bowl combine powdered sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla and water. \n0:46 Stir until combined\n0:50 Pour frosting atop cake\n0:56 Slice and serve!", "uploadDate": "2020-06-27T18:16:19+00:00", "duration": "PT1M1S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LOFgPvZchEE/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOFgPvZchEE?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOFgPvZchEE", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["9", "9 1 slice each"], "prepTime": "PT15M", "cookTime": "PT35M", "totalTime": "PT110M", "recipeIngredient": ["1.5 cups all-purpose flour ($0.27)", "1 cup granulated sugar ($0.96)", "\u00bd tsp salt ($0.02)", "1 tsp baking soda ($0.02)", "\u2153 cup unsweetened cocoa powder ($0.57)", "\u2153 cup cooking oil ($0.21*)", "1 Tbsp vinegar ($0.06**)", "1 tsp vanilla extract ($0.65)", "1 cup water ($0.00)", "1.5 cups powdered sugar ($0.48)", "\u00bc cup unsweetened cocoa powder ($0.42)", "3 Tbsp water ($0.00)", "1 tsp vanilla extract ($0.65)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Chocolate Cake", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.

Feel free to make substitutions.  For example, none of my local grocery stores had dumplings, so I used pot stickers instead.  It was a great substitution, IMHO, because there is a lot more protein in the pot stickers than the dumplings (and my husband and I learned about a year ago that we were not getting enough protein in our diets).  I used the Better Than Bullion Vegetable as suggested, but my husband--who loves salt--said he found it too salty, so when I make it next time I will either cut down on how much BTB-V I use or use vegetable stock or broth instead.  So that I didn't have to serve another vegetable, I added about 2 cups of spinach to the pot, and we both liked it.

While recipes for Pasta alla Puttanesca vary slightly, my comment has more to do with the origin of the name of this special - and delicious - sauce.  It is called that way because it includes the only ingredients that would be available to a \"Puttana\" of the time, in order for her to prepare a midnight little meal for her patron, after their night of frolics - and yes there was only one patron per night for a reputable, \"supported\" mistress (we are not talking about brothels here, where meals for clients were not offered) - so... no attracting clients by the way of the appealing smell. It only includes items that were shelf-stable, preserved pantry essentials, and nothing fresh at all (which is understandable, considering that the \"Puttane\" of the time were not allowed to leave the house during the day and go to the market to get fresh produce and ingredients). I am sure that there will be people who disagree with this explanation.

And, of course, it made my house smell amazing as it was baking. ;) Thank you for the awesome recipe!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rose"}, "datePublished": "2022-10-23"}], "recipeCategory": ["Dessert"], "recipeCuisine": ["American"], "keywords": "Apple Pie, Fruit Pie, Pie", "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "servingSize": "1 slice", "calories": "505 kcal", "carbohydrateContent": "67 g", "proteinContent": "6 g", "fatContent": "25 g", "sodiumContent": "267 mg", "fiberContent": "5 g"}, "@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/apple-pie/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/apple-pie/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/apple-pie/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Budget Bytes", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com", "description": "Delicious Recipes Designed for Small Budgets", "atomUrl": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 71903, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2025-10-29T08:30:00-05:00", "modified": "2025-10-29T08:30:15-05:00", "title": "Apple Pie", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Pie-Front-With-Ice-Cream.jpg", "author": "Monti Carlo", "categories": [{"@id": 12975, "parent": 55, "slug": "comfort-food", "name": "Comfort Food Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10045, "parent": 55, "slug": "cost-per-recipe", "name": "Cost Per Recipe", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10046, "parent": 55, "slug": "cost-per-serving", "name": "Cost Per Serving", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 33, "parent": 55, "slug": "dessert", "name": "Dessert Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12638, "parent": 12636, "slug": "fall-recipes", "name": "Fall Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12636, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 38, "parent": 55, "slug": "fruit", "name": "Fruit Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 55, "parent": 0, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes", "parents": []}, {"@id": 10051, "parent": 10045, "slug": "recipes-under-10", "name": "Recipes under $10", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 10045, "slug": "cost-per-recipe", "name": "Cost Per Recipe"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12636, "parent": 55, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 1385, "parent": 55, "slug": "soy-free", "name": "Soy Free Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10049, "parent": 10046, "slug": "under-1-per-serving", "name": "Under $1 per serving", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 10046, "slug": "cost-per-serving", "name": "Cost Per Serving"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 7, "parent": 55, "slug": "vegetarian", "name": "Vegetarian Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}], "tags": ["All-Purpose Flour", "Apple", "Cinnamon", "Egg", "Heavy Cream", "Lemon Juice", "Nutmeg", "Salted Butter", "Sugar"]}]}]

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/louisiana-red-beans-rice/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 lb. dry red beans ($1.49)\n2 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.08)\n14 oz. Andouille sausage ($3.79)\n1 yellow onion ($0.32)\n1 green bell pepper ($0.69)\n3 ribs celery ($0.46)\n4 cloves garlic ($0.32)\n2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.20)\n1 tsp dried oregano ($0.10)\n1 tsp dried thyme ($0.10)\n1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)\n1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.05)\n1/4 tsp cayenne pepper ($0.03)\n1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)\n2 bay leaves ($0.60)\n6 cups water ($0.00)\n1/4 cup chopped parsley ($0.20)\n1 Tbsp salt, or to taste ($0.10)\n1.5 cups long grain white rice (uncooked) ($0.93)\n3 green onions ($0.22)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. The night before, add the dry beans to a large bowl with double their volume in water. Allow the beans to soak in the refrigerator overnight.\n2. When you're ready to start cooking, slice the sausage into rounds. Add the cooking oil and sliced sausage to a large pot and cook over medium until the sausage pieces are browned. Remove the cooked sausage with a slotted spoon to a clean bowl. Place the cooked sausage in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the dish.\n3. While the sausage is cooking, dice the onion, bell pepper, and celery. Mince the garlic.\n4. After removing the cooked sausage, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot. Saut\u00e9 over medium heat, allowing the moisture from the vegetables to help dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the pot as you stir.\n5. Add the smoked paprika, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, black pepper, and bay leaves to the pot. Stir and cook for one minute more.\n6. Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with 6 cups water and give the pot a brief stir to combine the ingredients.\n7. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring it up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low, and let the pot boil for one hour, stirring occasionally. Replace the lid every time you stir.\n8. After boiling for one hour, the beans should be tender. Begin to smash the beans with the back of a spoon against the side of the pot. Continue smashing the beans and letting the pot simmer without a lid for 30 minutes to thicken the pot.\n9. While the beans are simmering for their final 30 minutes, cook the rice. Add the rice and 3 cups water to a sauce pot. Place a lid on top, turn the heat on to high, and bring it up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the rice simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice rest for 5 minutes without removing the lid. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.\n10. Once the red beans have thickened, add the cooked sausage back to the pot along with 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley. Stir to combine. Taste the red beans and add salt to your liking. Start with 1 tsp and add more as needed. I used 1 Tbsp total (3 tsp).\n11. Serve the red beans in a bowl topped with a scoop of rice and a sprinkle of sliced green onions.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:08 Soak beans\n0:13 Drain beans\n0:16 Cook sausage\n0:22 Saut\u00e9 onion, celery, bell peppers, garlic\n0:30 Add seasoning\n0:35 Add soaked beans and water\n0:42 Simmer\n0:46 Smash beans\n0:50 Return sausage to pot\n0:52 Add fresh parsley & salt\n0:58 Serve and enjoy", "uploadDate": "2022-03-06T16:00:02+00:00", "duration": "PT1M8S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awTM_rrfLKQ/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/awTM_rrfLKQ?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awTM_rrfLKQ", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["6", "6 1.5 cups red beans each"], "prepTime": "PT15M", "cookTime": "PT120M", "totalTime": "PT615M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 lb. dry red beans ($1.96)", "2 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.08)", "14 oz.

For those saying it got too thin after adding the spinach, maybe you're using frozen spinach instead of fresh? That'll def happen with frozen. It didn't happen when I used fresh. \r\n\r\nBUT here's an easy trick for that. I used all 8oz of the cream cheese block bc I was NOT about to just save 2oz in the fridge which kept it thick as heck lol Then I just used some reserved pasta water to get it to the right consistency after the spinach and pasta went in. \r\n\r\nI am keeping this one for future use - can't wait to try it with chicken or shrimp next time!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Lily"}, "datePublished": "2025-10-02"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "reviewBody": "A regular recipe in our house, slightly modified. I decided to trick my kids into eating the spinach by using an immersion blender to make a smooth sauce. I think this released water from the spinach, making the sauce too thin. \r\n\r\nI've been playing with adjusting the other ingredients to get a creamy sauce. Right now I'm at cutting the milk to 1-1.25 cups, upping cream cheese to a full 8 oz. brick (which also eliminates needing to find a use for the small leftover chunk), and doing a full cup of parmesan. I suspect it will probably vary from time to time, because how much spinach is in 4 c. will come down to how much I pack it down. If it's a tiny bit thin, I just simmer it down and/or sprinkle in a bit more parm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Russell"}, "datePublished": "2025-05-02"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "3"}, "reviewBody": "After adding the spinach the sauce becomes very watery.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John"}, "datePublished": "2025-01-15"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "reviewBody": "Used evaporated milk (instead of more expensive &amp; high fat cream) &amp; frozen spinach &amp; Mediterranean spice blend as too bland for me.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mary E"}, "datePublished": "2023-07-23"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "reviewBody": "I made this for my granddaughter\u2019s birthday.

A funny story--when I moved to Austin, Texas in 1986, the first thing I was assigned to bring to a office potluck was chili. Having grown up in the midwest and lived in the southeast much of my adult life, I immediately researched recipes and made a spectacular pot of Texas Red using round steak in about a 1/2\" dice, and very tender thanks to my pressure cooker--about 4 qts, no tomatoes, no beans, but lots of mild dried chilies and a bottle of beer. Cocoa and cumin are also included. The pot disappeared in almost a flash--at which point I learned from all of my astounded, but pleased, coworkers that they made chili the ordinary American way with tomatoes and beans. In Texas that means pinto beans, or at least it did in Texas in the 80s &amp; 90s. I still make my Texas Red from time to time, but not often--I tend to wait for DIL to do it and invite us over.

FULL RECIPE BELOW.\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/skillet-pineapple-bbq-chicken/\n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n 1 Tbsp cooking oil \n6 boneless skinless chicken thighs* (about 2.3 lbs.) \nPinch Salt and pepper \n20 oz. can Pineapple slices in juice \n1/2 cup BBQ sauce \n1 jalape\u00f1o (optional), sliced thinly \n2 green onions, sliced \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Heat a large skillet over medium. Once hot add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. While waiting for the skillet to heat, season both sides of the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n2. Once the skillet is hot and the oil is shimmering, add the chicken thighs and cook until golden brown on each side and cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken to a clean plate.\n3. While the chicken is cooking, drain and reserve the juice from the canned pineapple slices.\n4. After removing the chicken from the skillet, turn the heat down to low and add about 1/2 cup of the reserved pineapple juice. Stir to dissolve and loosen the browned chicken bits from the bottom of the skillet. Once everything has been loosened from the skillet, add the BBQ sauce and stir until a thick sauce forms. Taste the sauce and add salt if needed. If your sauce gets too thick, simply add another splash of the reserved pineapple juice.\n5. Add the cooked chicken thighs and pineapple slices to the skillet, dredging both sides in the pineapple BBQ sauce.  Spoon any excess sauce over the chicken.\n6. Adjust your oven's rack so that the skillet will be about 6 inches from the broiler unit and turn the broiler on to high. Transfer the skillet to the oven and broil for about 5 minutes, or just until the BBQ sauce caramelizes on the edges of the chicken and pineapple. If you don't have an oven safe skillet** you can transfer the chicken, pineapple, and ALL of the sauce to a casserole dish for broiling, or skip the broiling step and enjoy as is.\n7. After broiling, sprinkle the sliced jalape\u00f1o and green onion over top, and then serve.\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2019-06-22T17:33:31+00:00", "duration": "PT1M2S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJlKlRai8Sw/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJlKlRai8Sw?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJlKlRai8Sw", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["6"], "prepTime": "PT5M", "cookTime": "PT25M", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)", "6  boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 2.3 lbs., $8.00*)", "20 oz. can pineapple slices ( in juice, $1.68)", "1/2 cup BBQ sauce ($0.68)", "1  jalape\u00f1o ( (optional) sliced thinly, $0.33)", "2  green onions (sliced, $0.20)", "pinch  salt ($0.02)", "pinch  freshly cracked black pepper ($0.03)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium.

FULL RECIPE BELOW.\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/spicy-coconut-vegetable-stir-fry/\n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nSPICY COCONUT SAUCE\n1 13.5 oz can full-fat coconut milk\n1/4 cup natural style peanut butter\n2 Tbsp sriracha \n1 tsp brown sugar \n1 Tbsp soy sauce\n2 Tbsp lime juice (about one lime) \n1 clove garlic, minced \n1 tsp grated fresh ginger \n\nSTIR FRY\n4-6 cups mixed vegetables \n1 Tbsp high heat cooking oil of choice \n\nOPTIONAL FOR SERVING\n4 cups cooked rice (or 8oz. noodles) \n1/4 cup chopped peanuts \n1/4 cup chopped cilantro\n1 lime (cut into wedges) \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, peanut butter, sriracha, brown sugar, soy sauce, lime juice, minced garlic, and grated ginger. If needed, gently heat the sauce in the microwave or in a sauce pot to help the peanut butter melt into the coconut milk. Taste the sauce and adjust the heat (sriracha), salt (soy sauce), sweetness (brown sugar), or tartness (lime juice) to your liking.\n2. Chop your vegetables, if not pre-chopped. Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once hot, add the vegetables to the skillet in order of hardest to softest to allow harder vegetables, like carrots, more time to cook and to avoid over cooking softer vegetables. Stir fry the vegetables only for about 1-2 minutes, or just until they begin to soften on the edges because they will cook further once the sauce is added. If using a tender green, like spinach, wait to add it to the skillet until after the sauce has been added.\n3. Pour the prepared spicy coconut sauce over the vegetables, stir to combine, and allow the sauce to heat through (about 2 minutes). If you are using a tender green, like spinach, stir it into the hot sauce and stir just until it has wilted.\n4. To serve, spoon the vegetables and sauce over a bowl of hot rice, or add pre-cooked noodles to the skillet and toss with the vegetables and sauce until combined. Top with chopped peanuts, cilantro, and serve with a wedge of lime to squeeze over top.\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2019-02-07T20:11:44+00:00", "duration": "PT59S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ocxXK5gFG-0/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ocxXK5gFG-0?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocxXK5gFG-0", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4"], "prepTime": "PT15M", "cookTime": "PT10M", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 13.5oz. can full-fat coconut milk ($1.79)", "1/4 cup natural style peanut butter ($0.28)", "2 Tbsp sriracha ($0.18)", "1 tsp brown sugar ($0.01)", "1 Tbsp soy sauce ($0.06)", "2 Tbsp lime juice (about one lime) ($0.22)", "1 clove garlic, minced ($0.08)", "1 tsp grated fresh ginger ($0.10)", "4-6 cups mixed vegetables ($1.93)", "1 Tbsp high heat cooking oil of choice ($0.04)", "4 cups cooked rice (or 8oz. noodles) ($0.70)", "1/4 cup chopped peanuts ($0.12)", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro ($0.22)", "1  lime (cut into wedges) ($0.22)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, peanut butter, sriracha, brown sugar, soy sauce, lime juice, minced garlic, and grated ginger.

Tabasco uses completely different peppers, as does my heat ingredient of choice for this delicious recipe. I used Thai Kitchen brand Thai red curry paste--a tiny 4 oz jar. It's made in Thailand, and contains red chili (not jalapenos), garlic, lemon grass, galangal (similar to ginger), salt, onion, kafir lime. There are no chemical preservatives listed. I bought this at my local supermarket. It costs a bit more than sriracha, but is still inexpensive.\r\n\r\nMy preferred Thai curry pastes are Maesri and Mai Ploy brands which come in 4 oz cans and which I have to mail order. Red chili and Panang curries are about the same thing.

I had the natural kind of peanut butter on hand tonight instead of the usual Jif or whatever, and I think the slightly coarser texture was really good in the sauce. I forgot to get a lime, but subbed the juice of one Meyer lemon and it added nice acidity. I was feeling fancy tonight, so I also stir fried some pork loin and added that, although I usually make this vegan and love it that way too. This is fantastic with all kinds of veggies; it's one of those recipes that you can buy specific things for, or just clean out the fridge! Tonight, I used carrots, half a head of purple cabbage, frozen broccoli crowns, and a couple big handfuls of fresh spinach leaves. I served over jasmine rice and topped each portion with crushed peanuts. It was colorful, super filling, and made a ton! I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. \r\n\r\nI recommend this recipe to everyone I know. Thanks for all your hard work, Beth!

This one is easiest and wonderful. \r\n\r\nThe women in my father's family always cooked corn in milk. My mother didn't, nor do I typically do so, but corn has a great affinity for recipes that include dairy. Everyone I knew back in those days before microwaves and recipes for grilled and roasted veggies, boiled corn, either on the ear or cut kernels, with a little dab of sugar and saved the salt until it was cooked. I learned to cook other sweet veggies such as fresh green peas, baby limas, and carrots with a touch of sugar instead of salt. It keeps them tender and enhances natural sweetness. I use maybe 1/4 tsp per 1/2 cup of cooking water, which is enough liquid for 2 c of veggies and is likely to be nearly all absorbed while cooking. Green vegetables, other than peas, need salted water both for flavor and to preserve the color.\r\n\r\nKeep these terrific side dish recipes coming!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "janmaus"}, "datePublished": "2024-11-13"}], "recipeCategory": ["Side Dish"], "recipeCuisine": ["American"], "keywords": "creamed corn", "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "servingSize": "1 serving (\u00bd a cup)", "calories": "137 kcal", "carbohydrateContent": "4 g", "proteinContent": "3 g", "fatContent": "12 g", "sodiumContent": "320 mg", "fiberContent": "0.1 g"}, "@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/creamed-corn/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/creamed-corn/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/creamed-corn/"}]}]
