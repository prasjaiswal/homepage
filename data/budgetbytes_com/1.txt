Add the ground beef and olive oil to a pot and saut\u00e9 over medium until the beef is cooked through (about 5 minutes). If you're using a higher fat content beef (10% or higher), you may want to drain the excess fat once the beef has browned.\n2. While the beef is cooking, finely dice the onion. Add the diced onion and butter to the cooked beef. Continue to saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft and translucent (about 5 minutes).\n3. Next, add the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning blend, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir everything to combine.\n4. Place a lid on the pot and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes.\n5. After a minimum of 30 minutes simmering, add about 1/2 tsp salt, stir to combine, then taste and add more if needed. The flavor of the sauce will deepen and the complexities will pop once the salt is added.

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47 \n\nGet recipe FAQs, substitutions, and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/tuna-noodle-casserole/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 yellow onion, diced ($0.32)\n4 Tbsp butter, divided ($0.44)\n8 oz. mushrooms, sliced ($1.69)\n3/4 tsp salt, divided ($0.04)\n1/4 tsp pepper ($0.02)\n2 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.02)\n2 cups whole milk ($0.40)\n1 cup vegetable or chicken broth ($0.13)\n4 oz. cream cheese ($0.75)\n1/2 cup frozen peas ($0.25)\n8 oz. wide egg noodles ($0.70)\n2 Tbsp breadcrumbs ($0.08)\n2 Tbsp grated Parmesan ($0.22)\n12 oz. chunk light tuna, drained ($1.79)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Finely dice the onion and add it to a skillet with 1 Tbsp butter. Saut\u00e9 the onion over medium heat until softened.\n2. While the onion is cooking, slice the mushrooms. Add them to the skillet with the onion and \u00bc tsp each of salt and pepper. Continue saut\u00e9ing over medium heat until the mushrooms have softened. Remove the mushrooms and onions from the skillet and set aside.\n3. Add the flour and an additional 2 Tbsp butter to the skillet. Cook and whisk over medium heat as the butter melts. Continue whisking as the butter and flour bubbles and foams for about one minute.\n4. Add the milk, broth, and cream cheese to the skillet. Whisk to combine with the butter and flour mixture. Continue cooking over medium, whisking until the cream cheese has fully melted in and the sauce begins to simmer, at which point it will thicken.\n5. Add the frozen peas and the cooked mushrooms and onions back to the sauce. Stir to combine, then season with more salt and pepper (about \u00bd tsp salt and another pinch of pepper). Set the sauce aside.\n6. Begin to preheat the oven to 350\u00baF. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the noodles. Once boiling, add the egg noodles and boil for about 7 minutes, or just until tender. Drain the noodles in a colander.\n7. While the noodles are boiling, prepare the breadcrumb topping. Melt 1 Tbsp butter, then stir in the breadcrumbs and Parmesan.\n8. Combine the creamy mushroom sauce, cooked and drained noodles, and drained tuna.\n9. Transfer the casserole mixture to a 3-quart casserole dish, then top with the breadcrumb topping.\n10. Bake the casserole for about 25 minutes or until heated through and golden brown on top.

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/spinach-pie/ \n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 sheet puff pastry ($2.40)\n1 lb. frozen chopped spinach ($1.99)\n1 yellow onion ($0.32)\n1 clove garlic ($0.08)\n1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)\n1 cup cottage cheese ($0.40)\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan ($0.44)\n1/8 tsp nutmeg ($0.02)\n1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)\n1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)\n3 large eggs, divided ($0.63)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Make sure to take the puff pastry and spinach out ahead of time to thaw (spinach can be thawed quickly in the microwave, if needed, but do not thaw the puff pastry in the microwave). Preheat the oven to 375\u00baF.\n2. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, and olive oil to a skillet and saut\u00e9 over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent. Set the onions and garlic aside to cool slightly.\n3. Add the cottage cheese, Parmesan, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and two of the eggs to a bowl, and stir to combine (save the third egg to brush on top of the pastry before baking).\n4. Squeeze out as much water as possible from the thawed spinach. Add the squeezed spinach and saut\u00e9ed onion and garlic to the bowl with the cheese mixture. Stir to combine again.\n5. Place a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface (or dust lightly with flour) and roll the thawed puff pastry out until it's just slightly larger, about 10x10 inches.\n6. Drape the rolled pastry dough out over a pie plate. Spread the spinach and cheese mixture inside the pastry dough, then take the corners and fold them in toward the center. The pastry will not fully cover the top, but that's okay (see step by step photos below).\n7. Lightly whisk the remaining egg and brush it over the surface of the pastry dough. Bake the spinach pie for about 45 minutes, or until the pasty on top has puffed up significantly and turned golden brown.\n8. Remove the spinach pie from the oven, let sit for about five minutes, then slice into eight pieces and serve.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:07 Saut\u00e9 onion & garlic\n0:12 Combine cheese, seasoning, and egg\n0:23 Thaw and squeeze spinach\n0:25 Combine spinach, onion, and cheese\n0:31 Roll out pastry\n0:38 Fill pastry\n0:46 Brush with egg\n0:47 Bake pie\n0:52 Serve and enjoy", "uploadDate": "2022-02-20T17:32:53+00:00", "duration": "PT1M3S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RiwWmJ4IVT8/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiwWmJ4IVT8?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiwWmJ4IVT8", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["8", "8 slices"], "prepTime": "PT15M", "cookTime": "PT45M", "totalTime": "PT60M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 sheet puff pastry ($2.40)", "1 lb. frozen chopped spinach ($1.99)", "1  yellow onion ($0.32)", "1 clove garlic ($0.08)", "1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)", "1 cup cottage cheese ($0.40)", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan ($0.44)", "1/8 tsp nutmeg ($0.02)", "1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)", "1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)", "3  large eggs, divided ($0.63)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make sure to take the puff pastry and spinach out ahead of time to thaw (spinach can be thawed quickly in the microwave, if needed, but do not thaw the puff pastry in the microwave).

I got so excited to wrangle up those cubes of beef that I forgot to roll \u2018em in flour before tossing them into the pan. No big deal, though. Once all the meat was cooked and I was ready to add the veggies, I grabbed my flour and some water, whipped up a quick slurry, and stirred it into the pot. Let it cook for about a minute, and boom \u2013 problem solved.\r\n\r\nThe second little hitch in my giddy-up came after I simmered it for an hour and 15 minutes and then added the potatoes. After another 30 minutes, the stew was smelling like a dream, but the juice was a little too thin for my liking. So, I mixed up 1/4 cup of cornstarch with a cup of water and slowly stirred it in. The result? A stew so rich and hearty, it practically begged to be ladled over a pile of noodles.\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell ya, none of these tweaks messed with the downright incredible flavor of this dish.

Caramelized garlic, basil, and Parmesan add BIG flavor! FULL RECIPE BELOW. \n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/tuscan-white-bean-pasta/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n8 oz. linguine or fettuccine ($0.63)\n1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.13)\n1 Tbsp butter ($0.13)\n3 cloves garlic, minced ($0.24)\n1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes ($1.99)\n10 cranks freshly ground pepper ($0.03)\n1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)\n1/2 tsp dried basil ($0.05)\n1 15oz. can cannellini beans ($0.69)\n4 oz. baby spinach ($0.65)\n3 oz. shredded parmesan ($1.89)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Fill a large pot with water and place over high heat to bring it to a boil. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander.\n2. While you\u2019re waiting for the water to boil, mince the garlic. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for about a minute, or until it has softened and become very fragrant.\n3. Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper and basil. Saut\u00e9 the tomatoes until the skins burst and the tomatoes begin to release their juices. It's important to not have the heat under the skillet too high here or the garlic may burn before the tomatoes break down. You want the garlic to brown and caramelize a bit, but not burn.\n4. Once the tomatoes begin to break down, add the spinach and stir it into the tomatoes until it is about half way wilted. \n5. Rinse and drain the can of cannellini beans. Add the beans to the skillet and stir until they are heated through. The tomato juices will have created a thick sauce-like mixture on the bottom of the skillet at this point. Taste the mixture and add a bit more salt if needed. It should be slightly on the salty side in order to properly flavor the pasta.\n6. Add the cooked and drained pasta to the skillet. Toss until the pasta is coated in the sticky sauce and everything is combined. Top with shredded parmesan, plus add a bit of Parmesan to the top of each bowl.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:08 Boil Pasta\n0:15 Saut\u00e9 Garlic\n0:21 Add Tomatoes and Herbs\n0:31 Wilt Spinach\n0:38 Stir in Beans\n0:42 Add Cooked Pasta\n0:48 Top with Parmesan\n0:50 Serve", "uploadDate": "2021-01-10T15:30:09+00:00", "duration": "PT58S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2-Xcd2FLUtk/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2-Xcd2FLUtk?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Xcd2FLUtk", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT20M", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeIngredient": ["8 oz. linguine or fettuccine ($0.63)", "1 Tbsp olive oil  ($0.13)", "1 Tbsp butter ($0.13)", "3 cloves garlic, minced ($0.24)", "1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes  ($1.99)", "10  cranks freshly ground pepper  ($0.03)", "1/2 tsp salt  ($0.02)", "1/2 tsp dried basil  ($0.05)", "1 15oz. can cannellini beans ($0.69)", "4 oz. baby spinach ($0.65)", "3 oz. shredded parmesan ($1.89)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large pot with water and place over high heat to bring it to a boil.

Rinse the mushrooms and cut them into thick slices. Mince the garlic. Heat the garlic and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat for one to two minutes, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the mushrooms, a pinch of salt and freshly cracked pepper, and continue to saut\u00e9 until the mushrooms have softened and released all of their moisture (5-7 minutes).\n2. Add the uncooked orzo and chicken broth to the skillet. Give it a quick stir, place a lid on top, and let the mixture come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it quick stir again to loosen any pasta from the bottom of the skillet. Replace the lid, turn the heat down to low, and let the pasta simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Stir once half way through to prevent the pasta from sticking.\n3. After ten minutes, test the orzo to make sure it's tender (if not, replace the lid and let simmer a few minutes more). Stir the contents of the skillet to redistribute any leftover broth (it will continue to absorb into the pasta). Once the broth has absorbed, turn off the heat.\n4. Sprinkle the Parmesan over the pasta, stir, and then serve.\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2017-10-13T18:50:47+00:00", "duration": "PT58S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tagx2TGzjy0/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tagx2TGzjy0?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tagx2TGzjy0", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["6", "6 1 cup each"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT20M", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeIngredient": ["2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)", "2 cloves garlic ($0.16)", "8 oz baby portobello mushrooms ($2.19)", "Pinch of salt and pepper ($0.05)", "2 cups uncooked orzo ($1.50)", "3 cups chicken broth* ($0.45)", "1/3 cup grated Parmesan ($0.55)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the mushrooms and cut them into thick slices.

If I want faster results, I dice them into 3/4 - 1\" cubes and oven roast. While several folks suggest using the slow cooker, it makes steamed potatoes. While those are delicious, they aren't the same texture as oven roasted. Left over sweets are a handy lunch and also make delicious hash--lots of recipes online, but my fave uses diced bacon to flavor the veggies.

Mince the garlic, grate the ginger, and dice the onion. Add the olive oil, garlic, and ginger to a deep skillet, Dutch oven, or soup pot. Saut\u00e9 the garlic and ginger over medium heat for 1 minute, or just until the garlic becomes soft and fragrant.\n2. Add the diced onion to the skillet and continue to saut\u00e9 over medium until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the curry powder and continue to saut\u00e9 for about one minute more to toast the spices.\n3. Add the dry lentils and vegetable broth to the skillet. Stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Place a lid on top, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the broth to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low, and let it simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n4. After simmering for 20 minutes the lentils should be tender and most of the broth absorbed. Add the can of coconut milk and stir to combine. Turn the heat back up to medium and allow the skillet to come back up to a simmer. Let it simmer without a lid for an additional 10 minutes, stirring often, to thicken the mixture.\n5. Once thickened, turn the heat off. Add the fresh spinach and stir gently until the spinach has wilted. Taste the mixture and adjust the salt or curry powder to your liking, if needed.\n6. Serve over a bowl of rice, and top with chopped cilantro if desired.\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2019-09-23T19:13:16+00:00", "duration": "PT1M2S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KjuTLTQsRZE/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KjuTLTQsRZE?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjuTLTQsRZE", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4", "4 1.25 cups curry lentils + 1 cup rice"], "prepTime": "PT5M", "cookTime": "PT40M", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeIngredient": ["2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.24)", "2 cloves garlic ($0.16)", "1 tsp grated fresh ginger ($0.10)", "1 small yellow onion ($0.21)", "1 Tbsp  curry powder* ($0.30)", "1 cup brown lentils (dry) ($0.67)", "2 cups vegetable broth** ($0.26)", "1 13oz. can coconut milk ($1.99)", "3 cups fresh baby spinach ($1.61)", "4 cups cooked rice ($0.60)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro ($0.15)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mince the garlic, grate the ginger, and dice the onion.

It also meal preps well for lunches all week! FULL RECIPE BELOW. \ud83d\udc47\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-teriyaki-chicken-and-rice/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2/3 lb.) ($2.81)\n1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)\n2 cloves garlic, minced ($0.16)\n1 tsp grated fresh ginger ($0.10)\n1.5 cups uncooked jasmine rice ($0.99)\n2.5 cups water ($0.00)\n12 oz. frozen stir fry vegetables ($1.59)\n1/4 cup soy sauce ($0.24)\n2 Tbsp brown sugar ($0.08)\n1 tsp toasted sesame oil ($0.10)\n2 green onions, sliced ($0.15)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Prepare the teriyaki sauce. In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, and toasted sesame oil. The brown sugar may not fully dissolve, but that's okay. Set the sauce aside.\n2.Cut the chicken breast into very small pieces, about 1/2 to 3/4-inch in size.\n3. Add the cooking oil, garlic, and ginger to a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, then add the chicken pieces and continue to saut\u00e9 just until the outside of the chicken is no longer pink. Do not over cook the chicken here, it will finish cooking with the rice.\n4. Add the uncooked rice to the skillet and continue to saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes more. You should hear the rice popping. Finally, add the water and give everything a brief stir to make sure there is no rice stuck to the bottom of the skillet.\n5. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the water to come to a full boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 10 minutes.\n6. After the rice has simmered for 10 minutes, lift the lid briefly to sprinkle the frozen vegetables on top, then replace the lid immediately. Make sure the vegetables are spread evenly over the surface. Let the skillet continue to heat over low for an additional five minute.\n7. After steaming the rice and vegetables together for 5 minutes, turn the heat off and let the skillet rest with the lid in place for an additional five minutes.\n8. Give the teriyaki sauce another brief stir, lift the lid on the skillet, and drizzle the sauce over the vegetables. Make sure to scrape out all the sugar from the bottom of the bowl. Using a spatula or large spoon, gently fold the rice and vegetables together until everything is mostly coated in the sauce. Make sure to scoop all the way to the bottom of the skillet when folding, as the sauce will sink to the bottom.\n9. Place the lid back on top and let the skillet rest for a final 5 minutes to let the flavor soak in (heat turned off). Sprinkle sliced green onions over top just before serving. \n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 One Pot Teriyaki Chicken and Rice\n0:09 Mix soy sauce,  brown sugar and sesame oil in a bowl.\n0:15 Dice chicken breast\n0:22 Add to pan with garlic and ginger\n0:26 Saut\u00e9\n0:29 Add jasmine rice to pan\n0:33 Add water to pan\n0:38 Simmer\n0:42 Add frozen vegetables\n0:46 Steam\n0:50 Fold in sauce\n0:59 Top with green onions", "uploadDate": "2020-09-06T18:24:00+00:00", "duration": "PT1M8S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MEVB8ja-kXQ/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MEVB8ja-kXQ?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEVB8ja-kXQ", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4", "4 about 2 cups each"], "prepTime": "PT5M", "cookTime": "PT30M", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeIngredient": ["1  boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2/3 lb.)

We use it frequently since my then 4 year old grandson introduced it to us years ago. His preK4 teacher was committed to providing new tastes for kids--a variety of fruits and veggies for a start, but different cheeses, herbs, and seasonings, too. One of her early introductions was sliced Swiss cheese on Ritz crackers melted in the microwave and sprinkled with Tony Chachere.

These meatballs are both easy and delicious. Watch this video to learn how to make turkey and stuffing meatballs for your next party, or serve them as part of a Thanksgiving-inspired dinner.\n\nTurkey and stuffing meatballs are the perfect Thanksgiving appetizer. Watch this video to learn how to make these tasty meatballs!  FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs, serving suggestions, and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/turkey-and-stuffing-meatballs/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 6oz. box stuffing mix ($0.69)\n1 cup hot water* ($0.00)\n19 oz. ground turkey (93% lean) ($3.49)\n1 large egg, lightly beaten ($0.26)\n2 Tbsp butter ($0.26)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF. Place the dry stuffing mix in a large bowl, add the hot water, and stir until no more water pools on the bottom of the bowl. Let the stuffing sit for another 5 minutes to further soften. (Less water is added to the stuffing mix than is listed on the box in order to leave room for the absorption of moisture from the turkey and egg.)\n2. Add the ground turkey and beaten egg to the bowl with the partially hydrated stuffing mix. Combine these ingredients by hand until they are evenly mixed. Form the mixture into 20 meatballs, slightly larger than ping pong balls, or about 3 Tbsp each.\n3. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then place the meatballs on the parchment. Bake the meatballs for 20 minutes in the preheated oven.\n4. Melt 1 Tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half of the baked meatballs and allow them to cook in the butter until browned on most sides (about 5 minutes). Transfer the browned meatballs to a serving dish, add a second tablespoon of butter to the skillet, and repeat with the second batch of meatballs. \n5. Serve warm over a bed of mashed potatoes or with gravy or cranberry sauce for dipping.\n\nNOTES\n*If your stuffing mix calls for chicken broth instead of water in the cooking instructions, use chicken broth for the meatballs as well.\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:08 Hydrate stuffing mix\n0:13 Add egg and ground turkey\n0:17 Shape meatballs\n0:25 Bake turkey meatballs\n0:31 Brown meatballs in butter\n0:36 Serve and enjoy!", "uploadDate": "2021-11-14T16:49:38+00:00", "duration": "PT49S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvPo9fZJkaM/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvPo9fZJkaM?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvPo9fZJkaM", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["20", "20 meatballs"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT30M", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 6oz. box stuffing mix ($0.69)", "1 cup hot water* ($0.00)", "19 oz. ground turkey (93% lean) ($3.49)", "1 large egg, lightly beaten ($0.26)", "2 Tbsp butter ($0.26)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF.

FULL RECIPE BELOW. \ud83d\udc47\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/maple-sage-breakfast-sausage/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n19 oz. ground turkey ($3.49)\n1 tsp dried sage ($0.10)\n1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)\n1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.03)\n1/2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)\n1 Tbsp maple syrup ($0.30)\n1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)\nfreshly cracked pepper ($0.03)\n1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Add the ground turkey, sage, thyme, garlic powder, smoked paprika, maple syrup, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper to a bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until the ground turkey is evenly seasoned.\n2. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, portion and shape the ground meat mixture into patties. After measuring out 1/4 cup, make sure to flatten the patties until they are very thin, as they'll shrink inward and get thicker in the center as they cook. The shaped patties should be about 3-inches wide.\n3. To cook the Maple Sage Breakfast Sausage, add 1 Tbsp cooking oil to a skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, add the sausage patties (working in two batches if needed to prevent over crowding the skillet) and cook 3-5 minutes on each side, or until browned on the outside and cooked through. Serve hot.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/ \n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Intro\n0:09 Season Meat\n0:25 Shape Sausage Patties\n0:31 Cook Sausage", "uploadDate": "2020-09-20T15:45:02+00:00", "duration": "PT52S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N8-TN9NS3OI/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8-TN9NS3OI?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8-TN9NS3OI", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["5", "5 two patties each"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT20M", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeIngredient": ["19 oz. ground turkey ($3.49)", "1 tsp dried sage ($0.10)", "1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)", "1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.03)", "1/2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)", "1 Tbsp maple syrup ($0.30)", "1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)", "freshly cracked pepper ($0.03)", "1 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.04)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the ground turkey, sage, thyme, garlic powder, smoked paprika, maple syrup, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper to a bowl.

FULL RECIPE BELOW.\n\nPrintable recipe: https://www.budgetbytes.com/roasted-cauliflower-and-quinoa-salad/\n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n 1 head cauliflower \n1 small red onion \n2 Tbsp olive oil \npinch salt and pepper \n2 Tbsp butter\n2 cloves garlic, minced \n1 tsp turmeric \n1/2 tsp cumin \n1/8 tsp cinnamon \n2 cups quinoa\n1/3 cup dried cranberries \n3 cups vegetable broth\n1/4 cup sliced almonds \n1 cup chopped parsley \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF. Chop the cauliflower into florets and slice the red onion into 1/4-inch strips. Place the cauliflower florets and sliced red onion into a large bowl, along with the olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the cauliflower and onion until they are well coated in oil.\n2. Spread the cauliflower and onion out onto a large baking sheet, then transfer them to the oven. Roast the vegetables for 20 minutes, give them a good stir, then roast for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the onions are caramelized and the cauliflower is browned.\n3. Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa. Rinse the quinoa well in a wire mesh sieve. Add the butter, garlic, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon, to a medium sauce pot. Place the pot over medium heat. Stir and cook the spices for one minute.\n4. Add the drained quinoa to the pot with the butter and spices. Also add the dried cranberries and vegetable broth. Stir to combine, then place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring it up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for 20 minutes, with the lid in place.\n5. After simmering over low for 20 minutes, the quinoa should have absorbed all of the broth. Remove the lid and fluff the quinoa. Add the sliced almonds and stir to combine. \n6. Allow the quinoa to cool slightly.\n7. Transfer the cooked quinoa and roasted cauliflower and red onion to a large bowl. Add the chopped parsley and stir until everything is combined. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to eat (can be eaten warm or cold). \n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2019-09-28T19:31:21+00:00", "duration": "PT1M3S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CFQMG7Ny3v0/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFQMG7Ny3v0?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFQMG7Ny3v0", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["6", "6 2 cups each"], "prepTime": "PT20M", "cookTime": "PT35M", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 head cauliflower  ($3.49)", "1 small red onion ($0.28)", "2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)", "pinch  salt and pepper ($0.05)", "2 Tbsp butter ($0.12)", "2 cloves garlic, minced ($0.08)", "1 tsp turmeric ($0.10)", "1/2 tsp cumin ($0.05)", "1/8 tsp cinnamon ($0.02)", "2 cups quinoa ($2.39)", "1/3 cup dried cranberries ($0.29)", "3 cups vegetable broth* ($0.39)", "1/4 cup sliced almonds ($0.44)", "1 cup chopped parsley ($0.45)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF.

The jammy red onions, crunchy almonds, sweet cranberries, and smokey cauliflower work SO well with this yellow quinoa. I halved everything except the cauliflower as this is quite a large recipe.

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs, substitutions, and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/sausage-breakfast-casserole/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 lb. country sausage ($3.49)\n12 oz. frozen peppers and onions ($1.25)\n10 large eggs ($2.08)\n1/2 cup milk ($0.20)\n1/4 tsp pepper ($0.02)\n1/2 lb. tortilla chips* ($1.50)\n8 oz. cheddar, shredded ($2.29)\n1 Tbsp butter ($0.10)\n\n1. INSTRUCTIONS\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00baF. If your frozen peppers are in strips, chop them into small pieces.\n2. Brown the sausage in a large skillet over medium heat. Once browned, add the frozen peppers and onions and continue to cook over medium heat until heated through. Remove the sausage and peppers from the heat and set aside.\n3. Whisk together the eggs, milk, and pepper.\n4. Use the butter to grease the inside of a 3-quart casserole dish. Place the tortilla chips in the bottom of the casserole dish and press them down, slightly crushing them until they lay fairly flat.\n5. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage and peppers to the casserole dish on top of the tortilla chips, leaving any liquid behind in the pan.\n6. Add \u00be of the shredded cheddar on top of the sausage and peppers. Stir slightly to combine the tortilla chips, sausage and peppers, and cheese.\n7. Pour the egg mixture over the ingredients in the casserole dish, then top with the remaining shredded cheddar. The ingredients will not be fully submerged in the egg mixture and that is okay. The eggs will puff slightly as they bake.\n8. Bake the breakfast casserole for about 40 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160\u00baF and the outer edges are lightly browned.\n9. Let the casserole cool for about five minutes, then slice into six or eight pieces and serve.\nNOTES\n* You don\u2019t have to weigh the chips. Check the weight listed on the bag and approximate the amount based on the bag size. For instance, if you have a one-pound (16oz.) bag, use about half of the bag of chips.\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here. https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:07 Brown Sausage\n0:10 Add onions and peppers\n0:16 Whisk eggs, milk, and pepper\n0:22 Butter casserole dish \n0:24 Layer ingredients\n0:40 Bake\n0:43 Serve and ENJOY", "uploadDate": "2022-05-22T14:00:12+00:00", "duration": "PT57S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uhFOjxCsZVs/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/uhFOjxCsZVs?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhFOjxCsZVs", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["6", "6 to 8"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT50M", "totalTime": "PT60M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 lb. country sausage ($3.49)", "12 oz. frozen peppers and onions ($1.25)", "10 large eggs ($2.08)", "1/2 cup milk ($0.20)", "1/4 tsp pepper ($0.02)", "1/2 lb. tortilla chips* ($1.50)", "8 oz. cheddar, shredded ($2.29)", "1 Tbsp butter ($0.10)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.

I'm lucky to have an independent baker in my smallish NC community who does perfect baguettes, so it's worth looking around your town to maybe find the real deal. This recipe produces incredible fried shrimp and catfish (I tried both, and didn't miss the cornmeal with the catfish strips). If you can't find the right bread just pile fried seafood and veggies on toast or serve the fried shrimp over a bed of lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and cucumbers and use the remoulade as a dressing.

I added a little ancho chili powder to the spice blend for the chicken (because I had it) and used pepperjack cheese instead of Monterey jack, as I had some I wanted to use up, but otherwise made the recipe as listed.  \r\n\r\nI did double the recipe to make enough portions for the week, and the only change I'd consider is- if you're going to double the recipe but eat it right after making (like if you're making it for dinner for a large family or something), you may want to reduce the chicken broth to 2.5-2.75 c instead of 3 c, as the sauce was a little thinner than I expected.  However, as the pasta sat in the fridge, it soaked up more of the liquid in the sauce, resulting in the thicker consistency I expected.  So, if making this for a meal prep, just leave it as is.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kaylee"}, "datePublished": "2024-06-06"}], "recipeCategory": ["Dinner"], "recipeCuisine": ["American"], "keywords": "buffalo chicken, Chicken Pasta Recipe, One Pot Pasta", "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "servingSize": "1.5 cups", "calories": "545 kcal", "carbohydrateContent": "46 g", "proteinContent": "30 g", "fatContent": "26 g", "sodiumContent": "1193 mg", "fiberContent": "2 g"}, "@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/buffalo-chicken-pasta/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/buffalo-chicken-pasta/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/buffalo-chicken-pasta/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Budget Bytes", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com", "description": "Delicious Recipes Designed for Small Budgets", "atomUrl": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 93198, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2024-04-10T08:47:46-05:00", "modified": "2025-09-04T13:37:49-05:00", "title": "Buffalo Chicken Pasta", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Buffalo-Chicken-Pasta-Fork.jpg", "author": "Beth Moncel", "categories": [{"@id": 10182, "parent": 34, "slug": "chicken-breasts", "name": "Chicken Breast Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 34, "slug": "chicken", "name": "Chicken Recipes"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 59, "slug": "meat", "name": "Meat Recipes"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10198, "parent": 27, "slug": "chicken-pasta", "name": "Chicken Pasta Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 27, "slug": "pasta", "name": "Pasta Recipes"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 34, "parent": 59, "slug": "chicken", "name": "Chicken Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 59, "slug": "meat", "name": "Meat Recipes"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12975, "parent": 55, "slug": "comfort-food", "name": "Comfort Food Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 6, "parent": 55, "slug": "main-dish", "name": "Main Dish Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 1386, "parent": 55, "slug": "one-pot", "name": "One Pot Meals", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 27, "parent": 55, "slug": "pasta", "name": "Pasta Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10197, "parent": 27, "slug": "quick-pasta", "name": "Quick Pasta Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 27, "slug": "pasta", "name": "Pasta Recipes"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 770, "parent": 55, "slug": "quick", "name": "Quick Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 55, "parent": 0, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes", "parents": []}, {"@id": 10051, "parent": 10045, "slug": "recipes-under-10", "name": "Recipes under $10", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 10045, "slug": "cost-per-recipe", "name": "Cost Per Recipe"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10047, "parent": 10046, "slug": "under-3-per-serving", "name": "Under $3 per serving", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 10046, "slug": "cost-per-serving", "name": "Cost Per Serving"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}], "tags": ["Butter", "Chicken Breast", "Chicken Broth", "Cream Cheese", "Diced Tomatoes", "Garlic Powder", "Green Onion", "Hot Sauce", "Monterey Jack", "Onion Powder", "Penne", "related-player-videos", "Worcestershire Sauce"]}]}]

Everything cooks in one pot and is done in under 30 minutes! FULL RECIPE BELOW. \ud83d\udc47\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/one-pot-creamy-pesto-chicken-pasta/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast ($5.56)\n2 Tbsp butter ($0.26)\n2 cloves garlic ($0.16)\n1/2 lb. penne pasta ($0.40)\n1.5 cups chicken broth ($0.20)\n1 cup milk ($0.32)\n3 oz. cream cheese ($0.29)\n1/3 cup basil pesto ($0.73)\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan ($0.44)\nfreshly cracked pepper ($0.03)\n1 pinch crushed red pepper ($0.02)\nOPTIONAL ADD-INS\n3 cup fresh spinach ($0.90)\n1/4 cup sliced sun dried tomatoes ($1.10)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch pieces. Add the butter to a deep skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the chicken is slightly browned on the outside.\n2. While the chicken is cooking, mince the garlic. Add the garlic to the skillet with the chicken and continue to saut\u00e9 for one minute more.\n3. Add the uncooked pasta and chicken broth to the skillet with the chicken and garlic. Stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the broth up to a boil.\n4. Once the broth comes to a full boil, give the pasta a quick stir, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the pasta simmer over medium-low heat for about 8 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and most of the broth has been absorbed. Stir the pasta briefly every two minutes as it simmers, replacing the lid quickly each time.\n5. Once the pasta is tender and most of the broth absorbed, add the milk, cream cheese (cut into chunks), and pesto. Stir and cook over medium heat until the cream cheese has fully melted into the sauce. Finally, add the grated Parmesan and stir until combined.\n6. If using, add the fresh spinach and sliced sun dried tomatoes. Stir until the spinach has wilted, then remove the pasta from the heat. Top the pasta with freshly cracked pepper and a pinch of crushed red pepper, then serve.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:09 Saut\u00e9 Chicken in Butter\n0:14 Add Minced Garlic\n0:17 Add Pasta and Broth\n0:24 Simmer\n0:31 Stir in Cream Cheese, Pesto, and Milk\n0:43 Add Parmesan\n0:47 Season with Pepper and Crushed Red Pepper\n0:49 Fold in Sun Dried Tomatoes and Spinach\n1:00 Serve and Enjoy!", "uploadDate": "2020-12-06T16:30:02+00:00", "duration": "PT1M8S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cxTSOlWNXy0/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxTSOlWNXy0?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxTSOlWNXy0", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4"], "prepTime": "PT5M", "cookTime": "PT20M", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast ($6.25)", "2 Tbsp butter ($0.28)", "2 cloves garlic ($0.16)", "1/2 lb. penne pasta ($0.67)", "1.5 cups chicken broth ($0.20)", "1 cup milk ($0.19)", "3 oz. cream cheese* ($0.80)", "1/3 cup basil pesto ($0.73)", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan ($0.44)", "freshly cracked pepper ($0.03)", "1 pinch  crushed red pepper ($0.02)", "3 cup fresh spinach ($0.90)", "1/4 cup sliced sun dried tomatoes ($1.10)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch pieces.

Perfect for a cozy weekend breakfast. FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-pancakes/\n\nIngredients\n1 cup all-purpose flour ($0.07)\n1.5 tsp baking powder ($0.03)\n1/2 tsp salt ($0.03)\n\u00be cup +2 Tbsp warm milk* ($0.02)\n2 Tbsp melted butter ($0.20)\n1 large egg ($0.21)\n2 Tbsp sugar ($0.02)\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract ($0.14)\n4 tsp cooking oil ($0.05)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, sugar, and vanilla extract.\n3. Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir until combined. The mixture should be thick, but still pourable. It\u2019s okay if the mixture is a bit lumpy. Let the batter rest for 15 minutes.\n4. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium. Once hot add enough cooking oil to coat the surface (I use about \u00bd tsp per pancake). Add the pancake batter to the hot griddle, \u00bc cup at a time. Use the back of the measuring cup to spread the batter into a 4.5-inch diameter circle.\n5. Cook the pancakes until bubbles form over the surface and begin to pop, the edges of the pancakes look dry, and the bottom is golden brown (about 60 seconds). Flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown (about 30 seconds).\n6. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the skillet between batches or as needed, until all of the pancakes have been cooked. Keep the pancakes warm on a plate under a towel or in a warm oven until all of the pancakes have been cooked. Serve warm with your favorite toppings!\n\nNotes\n*\u00be cup of milk makes a super thick batter, but slightly dry pancake. One cup of milk makes a thinner batter and pancakes that are not quite as thick and fluffy. \u00be cup plus 2 Tbsp milk made perfectly thick and fluffy pancakes. You can adjust the milk to make the batter the consistency that you prefer. Using slightly warm milk helps the butter stay melted, which allows it to incorporate evenly into the batter.\n\nSee how we calculate costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:08 Combine dry ingredients in a bowl\n0:13 Whisk together wet ingredients\n0:21 Combine wet and dry ingredients\n0:28 Heat skillet\n0:31 Add the pancake batter \n0:37 Flip pancake \n0:41 Keep cooked pancakes warm\n0:49 Serve and ENJOY\n\nhttps://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-pancakes/", "uploadDate": "2022-05-08T13:00:10+00:00", "duration": "PT1M4S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tD-FUOqO-7I/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tD-FUOqO-7I?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD-FUOqO-7I", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4", "4 2 pancakes each"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT20M", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup all-purpose flour ($0.18 *)", "1.5 tsp baking powder ($0.08)", "1/2 tsp salt ($0.03)", "\u00be cup warm milk ($0.14 **)", "2 Tbsp melted butter ($0.20)", "1 large egg ($0.67)", "2 Tbsp sugar ($0.12)", "1/2 tsp vanilla extract ($0.32)", "4 tsp cooking oil ($0.05 ***)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.", "name": "Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-pancakes/#wprm-recipe-64857-step-0-0"}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, sugar, and vanilla extract.", "name": "In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, sugar, and vanilla extract.", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-pancakes/#wprm-recipe-64857-step-0-1"}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until combined.

Beth has included the key ones in this recipe. First, and vital, the 15 minute wait!!! The purpose is two-fold--it  lets the flour get absorbed into the liquid, and starts the leavening to work. This works for both scratch made pancakes and those from mixes. Also important is to purchase baking powder in small amounts and replace often, certainly within a year so it's fresh and lively. If the baking power is a bit aged, try adding 50% more than a recipe calls for--it may help, but no guarantees. \r\n\r\nHonestly, that 15 minute wait isn't a hardship. Start your batter and then do all of the other little breakfast chores. Set the table, start the coffee, get your sides ready: that bowl of fruit or glasses of juice, heat your grill or skillet, whip some cream to go along with fresh fruit, put syrup on the table, etc. That 15 minute wait passes in less time than I ever imagine.\r\n\r\nI make 4\" pancakes and use a 12\" cast iron skillet which holds 3 at a time. I also use a 1/4 cup measure as Beth suggests. Larger pancakes are hard to turn. This recipe makes between 5-7--it's hard to make each of them perfect. Pancakes hold well in the fridge for a couple of days and revive in the toaster--up to a couple of months in the freezer. My well seasoned skillet takes only a dab of butter (1 tsp?) for frying each batch, so I use less oil than this recipe specifies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "janmaus"}, "datePublished": "2025-06-02"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "reviewBody": "Perfect didn\u2019t need to change a thing.

FULL RECIPE BELOW. \ud83d\udc47\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-broccoli-cheddar-soup/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 yellow onion ($0.52)\n1 lb. broccoli ($1.49)\n2 carrots ($0.23)\n4 Tbsp butter ($0.52)\n4 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.04)\n2 cups chicken broth ($0.24)\n2 cups whole milk ($0.75)\n1/2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)\n1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.02)\n1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)\n1/8 tsp cayenne pepper ($0.02)\n6 oz. sharp cheddar, shredded ($1.27)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Dice the onion. Chop the broccoli into very small pieces. Peel and slice the carrots.\n2. Add the butter and onion to a large soup pot and saut\u00e9 over medium until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the flour and continue to saut\u00e9 for about 2 minutes more, or until the flour is coating the bottom of the pot and is a light golden brown color.\n3. Add the chicken broth and whisk to dissolve all the flour off the bottom of the pot. Turn the heat up to medium-high and, while stirring often, allow the broth to come up to a simmer. When it reaches a simmer it will thicken to a gravy consistency.\n4. Turn the heat back down to medium and whisk in the milk, smoked paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Allow the broth to come back up to a simmer.\n5. Add the chopped broccoli and carrots, allow the broth to come back up to a simmer, and continue to simmer the vegetables, stirring often, for 15 minutes, or until the carrots are tender.\n6. Finally, turn the heat down to medium-low and stir the shredded cheese into the soup, one handful at a time, until it is fully melted. Taste the soup and add salt if needed (this will depend on the salt content of your broth-I did not add any).\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/ \n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Intro\n0:07 Saut\u00e9 onions in butter\n0:13 Add flour and Saut\u00e9\n0:17 Add Chicken broth and simmer\n0:24 Add spices and milk\n0:34 Add Broccoli and carrots\n0:42 Melt in cheddar\n0:58 Serve and enjoy!", "uploadDate": "2020-10-11T18:00:25+00:00", "duration": "PT1M9S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iqiIP8EfOeI/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqiIP8EfOeI?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqiIP8EfOeI", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4", "4 servings (2 cups each)"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT40M", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeIngredient": ["1  yellow onion ($0.70)", "1 lb. broccoli ($1.97*)", "2  carrots ($0.23)", "4 Tbsp butter ($0.40)", "4 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.04)", "2 cups chicken broth ($0.26**)", "2 cups whole milk ($0.36)", "\u00bd tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)", "\u00bc tsp garlic powder ($0.02)", "\u00bc tsp black pepper (freshly cracked, $0.02)", "\u215b tsp cayenne pepper ($0.02)", "6 oz. sharp cheddar cheese (shredded, $1.27)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Gather all of your ingredients.", "name": "Ingredients", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-broccoli-cheddar-soup/#wprm-recipe-51821-step-0-0"}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dice the onion and chop the broccoli into very small pieces.

I've tried multiple instructions, often with dreadful results, and after frustration and even tears, this is the only way I recommend boiling eggs. I read somewhere that the shock of hitting the boiling water frees the membrane from the shell, and it appears to be the case. Gentle is key. I put an egg in a large spoon or small strainer and gently lower it into the hard boiling water. I turn down the heat after it returns to boil as a continued hard boil may crack the eggs.\r\n\r\nMy go-to egg salad recipe is dryer than this--1/2 T mayo and 1/2 tsp dijon mustard per egg. I also like using capers and caper juice, but dill pickle and juice is often what's in my fridge and is delicious, too. Olives, either green or kalamata (although not the kalamata juice as it will discolor the salad), are another nice variation. One reason to continue using full fat mayo is the fact that vitamin A is fat soluble--use fat free mayo or yogurt and you won't capture its benefits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "janmaus"}, "datePublished": "2025-04-07"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "reviewBody": "I made it a bit different..no relish, but used a bit of dill pickle juice instead lemon juice and added dried dill for flavor!

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs, serving suggestions, and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/chicken-stew/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 yellow onion ($0.28)\n3 ribs celery ($0.64)\n4 cloves garlic ($0.32)\n1/2 lb. carrots ($0.32)\n1.75 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs ($6.52)\n4 Tbsp all-purpose flour, divided ($0.02)\n2 Tbsp butter ($0.18)\n1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)\n1.5 lbs. baby potatoes ($2.89)\n1 tsp dried parsley ($0.10)\n1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)\n1/2 tsp dried rosemary ($0.05)\n1/2 tsp dried sage ($0.05)\n1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)\n2 cups chicken broth ($0.26)\n2 cups vegetable broth ($0.26)\n1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional) ($0.10)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Dice the onion and celery, mince the garlic, slice the carrots, and cut the baby potatoes in half before you begin.\n2. Cut the chicken thighs into 1-inch pieces. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp of the flour over the chicken and toss until the chicken is evenly coated.\n3. Add the butter and olive oil to a large pot. Heat the butter and oil over medium until they are hot and sizzling.\n4. Add the flour-coated chicken to the pot with the butter and oil and allow the chicken to brown on all sides (avoid stirring until browned on the bottom). When the chicken is browned and there is a nice brown layer of flour on the bottom of the pot, remove the chicken to a clean bowl with a slotted spoon. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point, just browned on the outside.\n5. Add the onion, celery, garlic, and carrots to the pot and continue to saut\u00e9 until the onions are soft. Use the moisture released by the vegetables to dissolve and scrape the browned bits off the bottom of the pot.\n6. Once the vegetables are slightly softened, add the remaining 2 Tbsp flour to the pot and continue to saut\u00e9 over medium for about two minutes more. The flour will begin to coat the bottom of the pot again.\n7. Return the browned chicken to the pot. Also add the potatoes, parsley, thyme, rosemary, sage, pepper, chicken broth, and vegetable broth. Stir to combine and dissolve any flour off the bottom of the pot.\n8. Place a lid on the pot and allow it to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, remove the lid and turn the heat down to medium-low. Allow the stew to simmer over medium-low, without a lid and stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and the broth has thickened.\n9. Taste the stew and add salt if needed (I did not add any, but it will depend on the salt content of the broth you used). Add a tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley if desired, and serve hot.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:08 Coat chicken in flour\n0:12 Brown chicken thighs\n0:19 Remove Chicken\n0:22 Saut\u00e9 vegetables\n0:30 Add more flour\n0:33 Return chicken\n0:35 Add potatoes and seasonings\n0:42 Add broth\n0:45 Simmer\n0:50 Add fresh parsley\n0:52 Serve and Enjoy", "uploadDate": "2022-01-02T15:41:54+00:00", "duration": "PT1M1S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WctiyrP3sSw/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WctiyrP3sSw?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WctiyrP3sSw", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["6", "6 1.5 cups each"], "prepTime": "PT15M", "cookTime": "PT45M", "totalTime": "PT60M", "recipeIngredient": ["1  yellow onion ($0.28)", "3 ribs celery ($0.64)", "4 cloves garlic ($0.32)", "1/2 lb. carrots ($0.32)", "1.75 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs ($6.52)", "4 Tbsp all-purpose flour, divided ($0.02)", "2 Tbsp butter ($0.18)", "1  Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)", "1.5 lbs. baby potatoes ($2.89)", "1 tsp dried parsley ($0.10)", "1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)", "1/2 tsp dried rosemary ($0.05)", "1/2 tsp dried sage ($0.05)", "1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)", "2 cups chicken broth ($0.26)", "2 cups vegetable broth ($0.26)", "1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional) ($0.10)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dice the onion and celery, mince the garlic, slice the carrots, and cut the baby potatoes in half before you begin.", "name": "Dice the onion and celery, mince the garlic, slice the carrots, and cut the baby potatoes in half before you begin.", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/chicken-stew/#wprm-recipe-58560-step-0-0"}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the chicken thighs into 1-inch pieces.

This typo is (at the time of this writing) at the beginning of the first line in the text under the picture of the fork scraping the cooked squash (second to last photo).\r\n\r\nI believe there is also an error either in the total cost at the top of the article or the costs imbedded in the recipe for each ingredient.  I normally don\u2019t consciously pay attention to the pricing (and realize this varies by where one lives, time of year etc.) but I did notice that the math was way off.   If the pricing imbedded in the article is what you meant, then the total cost for the recipe would be $2.15 instead of $5.62 (and you got a fantastic deal on the spaghetti squash, I might add, if it was only $0.79 for 1 1/3 lb).  If the pricing at the top of the article is correct, there is a typo in the imbedded pricing for ingredients (probably the price of the squash\u2026 and wow spaghetti squash, even if you bought organic,  is incredibly expensive per pound where you are for being in season if you really used a 1 1/3 lb squash that cost $4.26\u2026 maybe the weight of the squash listed in the ingredients is off and that is what threw off the calculations?).\r\n\r\nSorry to nit pick since none of this impacts following the recipe but figured you would want to know since proof reading one\u2019s own typing is always more difficult than proof reading somebody else\u2019s.   Nice, straightforward instructions for a timely recipe for the northern hemisphere (spaghetti squash is ready in the garden so my family and a lot of my neighbors have been including roasted spaghetti squash in our meal planning the last few weeks and will continue doing so for the foreseeable future\u2026 was quite the bumper crop this year!

Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.\n2. Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point.\n3. Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to saut\u00e9 for about 2 minutes more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.\n4. Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. 5. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.\n6. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy.\n7. Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks, then stir until it has melted into the sauce. Top the pasta with sliced green onions and serve.\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2018-12-30T00:42:54+00:00", "duration": "PT1M1S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qV0F5FiXUXw/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qV0F5FiXUXw?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV0F5FiXUXw", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT20M", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeIngredient": ["2  tsp smoked paprika ($0.20)", "1 tsp oregano ($0.10)", "1 tsp  thyme ($0.10)", "1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)", "1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.05)", "1/4 tsp cayenne pepper ($0.03)", "1/4 tsp black pepper ($0.02)", "1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)", "1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)", "1 Tbsp butter ($0.13)", "1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast ($5.47)", "1  yellow onion, diced ($0.32)", "1/2 lb. penne pasta (uncooked) ($0.75)", "15 oz. fire roasted diced tomatoes ($1.00)", "2 cups chicken broth ($0.26)", "2 oz. cream cheese ($0.50)", "3  green onions, sliced ($0.25)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl.

Thank you for another house favorite meal, Beth! I, like Puck, had way too much liquid by the time this was due to be finished. I spooned out about a half cup and left the rest to soak into the pasta. This is also the first recipe I used smoked vs normal paprika for, and I have to say smoked is a hard requirement for the flavors you want here, as are the fire roasted tomatoes. I also added a diced yellow bell pepper with the onion and then some broccoli florets for extra veggies/to coat on the sauce.

The Nutella (1.5tbsp) was sitting on top and I had to scoop batter from the sides to bury it. Microwaved 1min30sec. My daughter said it tasted good but was dry. \r\nThe next mug had a little more milk and resulted in a wetter batter that I easily funneled in the center to add the Nutella. I cut back 6 seconds on the cooking time. I think I nearly nailed it.

FULL RECIPE BELOW.\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/vegan-winter-lentil-stew/\n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n 2 Tbsp olive oil \n1 yellow onion \n4 cloves garlic \n4 carrots (about 1/2 lb.) \n4 stalks celery \n2 lbs potatoes \n1 cup brown lentils\n1 tsp dried rosemary \n1/2 tsp dried thyme\n2 Tbsp Dijon mustard \n1.5 Tbsp soy sauce \n1 Tbsp brown sugar\n6 cups vegetable broth \n1 cup frozen peas\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the olive oil, onion, and garlic to a large soup pot and begin to saut\u00e9 over medium heat.\n2. While the onion and garlic are saut\u00e9ing, dice the celery, then add it to the pot and continue to saut\u00e9. 3. As the celery, onion, and garlic are saut\u00e9ing, peel and chop the carrots into half rounds. Add the carrots to the pot and continue to saut\u00e9.\n4. As the onion, garlic, celery, and carrots are saut\u00e9ing, peel and cube the potatoes into 3/4 to 1-inch pieces. Add the cubed potatoes to the pot along with the lentils, rosemary, thyme, Dijon, soy sauce, brown sugar, and vegetable broth.\n5. Briefly stir the ingredients to combine, then place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and bring the stew up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n6. Toward the end of the simmer time, when the potatoes are very soft, begin to mash the potatoes a bit as you stir. This will help thicken the stew.\n7. Finally, after 30 minutes, stir in the frozen peas and allow them to heat through. Taste the stew and add salt if needed (this will depend on the salt content of your broth, I did not add any extra). Serve hot and enjoy!\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2019-01-06T19:19:18+00:00", "duration": "PT56S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ll4U62_i6IY/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ll4U62_i6IY?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll4U62_i6IY", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["8", "8 1.5 cups each"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT50M", "totalTime": "PT60M", "recipeIngredient": ["2 Tbsp  olive oil ($0.44)", "1  yellow onion ($0.70)", "4 cloves garlic ($0.16)", "4  carrots (about 1/2 lb.)

Perfect for potlucks! FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/tomato-mozzarella-pasta-salad/\n\nFull Recipe \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nINGREDIENTS\n8 oz. bowtie pasta\nsalt for pasta water\n3 cups fresh spinach\n1 pint grape tomatoes\n8 oz. mozzarella* \n\nPARMESAN BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE\n1/3 cup olive oil\n3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar\n2 Tbsp mayonnaise\n2 Tbsp grated Parmesan\n1/2 Tbsp Dijon mustard\n1 clove garlic, minced\n1/2 tsp dried basil\n1/4 tsp salt\nfreshly cracked pepper\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Fill a pot with water and add two large pinches of salt. Cover the pot and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Drain the pasta in a colander, give it a brief rinse with cool water, and let it drain well while you prepare the rest of the salad.\n2. While waiting for the pasta to cook, prepare the rest of the salad. Start with the Parmesan Balsamic Vinaigrette. Combine all the dressing ingredients in a jar or blender. Either blend until combined or shake your jar until the ingredients are well combined. Set the dressing aside until needed.\n3. Roughly chop the spinach and slice the grape tomatoes in half. Dice the mozzarella into 1/2-inch cubes.\n4. Add the spinach, tomatoes, and mozzarella to a large bowl. Once the pasta is well drained and mostly cool, add it to the bowl with the mozzarella and vegetables. Make sure the pasta is no longer hot, so it doesn't wilt the spinach or melt the cheese.\n5. Toss the ingredients to combine. If serving the salad later, store it like this without dressing. If serving immediately, add half of the dressing and toss to coat. Add more dressing as desired.\n\nNOTES\n*Fresh mozzarella is best, but block or stick mozzarella can be used in its place. Whole milk mozzarella (not part-skim), if possible.\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes", "uploadDate": "2020-03-07T19:08:24+00:00", "duration": "PT1M1S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UoM0MmkUHMc/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoM0MmkUHMc?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoM0MmkUHMc", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["6", "6 about 1.5 cups each"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT15M", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeIngredient": ["8 oz. bowtie pasta ($0.67)", "salt for pasta water ($0.02)", "3 cups fresh spinach ($1.20)", "1 pint grape tomatoes ($2.50)", "8 oz. mozzarella* ($2.60)", "1/3 cup olive oil ($0.55)", "3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar ($0.41)", "2 Tbsp  mayonnaise ($0.17)", "2 Tbsp grated Parmesan ($0.22)", "1/2 Tbsp  Dijon mustard ($0.09)", "1 clove garlic, minced ($0.08)", "1/2 tsp dried basil ($0.05)", "1/4 tsp salt ($0.01)", "freshly cracked pepper ($0.02)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a pot with water and add two large pinches of salt.

I made my own apple butter two weeks ago using Stevia instead of sugar, plus 3 T of blackstrap molasses to provide color and depth of flavor. Since sugar is also a preservative, this version of Apple Butter needs to be refrigerated and will only keep weeks instead of years. It was not planned for this recipe, but was fortuitous.

It's significantly better than anything your supermarket has. I prefer it largely because the commercial brands are really loaded with salt.

My personal favorites, they are deliciously creamy, with a milder flavor than kidney beans--they are the beans used for canned refries. I also have a trick for making my quesadillas. I brush one side with a bit of oil or butter, then lay it fat side down flat on the hot skillet, put down the shredded cheese first--as it melts, it acts like glue to hold the filling together. Then put on the rest of the ingredients across the whole tortilla. Watch carefully not to burn, and when nice and toasty, fold it.

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47\n\nGet recipe FAQs and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/pizza-roll-ups/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n8 small flour tortillas* ($1.03)\n40 slices pepperoni ($1.32)\n4 mozzarella cheese sticks ($0.83)\noil, as needed ($0.05)\n1/2 cup pizza sauce (for dipping) ($0.48)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF. Lightly spritz a baking sheet with spray oil or brush a thin layer of your favorite cooking oil onto the baking sheet.\n2. Stack about 4 tortillas at a time on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave for 20-30 seconds, or until they are steamy and pliable. Microwave the second batch when you're ready to roll more.\n3. Slice each of the mozzarella sticks in half, lengthwise. Place about 5 pepperoni on each tortilla in the bottom 1/3 o the circle, then place the halved mozzarella stick on top. Fold the sides of the tortilla in to cover the ends, then roll them up tight light a burrito.\n4. Place the tightly rolled Pizza Roll Ups on the baking sheet, seam side down. Leave them slightly apart from one another to allow hot air to surround the rolls. Either spritz the top with spray oil, or brush a thin layer of oil on top of the roll ups.\n5. Bake the Pizza Roll Ups for 12-15 minutes, or until they're lightly browned and the cheese is just beginning to ooze. Because every oven is different, begin checking on the Pizza Roll Ups at about 10 minutes, then check ever two minutes or so until they're done.\n6. Serve immediately, with pizza sauce for dipping.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:10 Slice cheese sticks in half\n0:24 Fill and roll tortillas\n0:38 Brush with oil\n0:43 Bake\n0:45 Serve and enjoy", "uploadDate": "2022-02-27T21:16:09+00:00", "duration": "PT59S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/arc3bxld0JM/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/arc3bxld0JM?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arc3bxld0JM", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4", "4 2 rolls each"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT15M", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeIngredient": ["8  small flour tortillas* ($1.03)", "40 slices pepperoni ($1.32)", "4  mozzarella cheese sticks ($0.83)", "oil, as needed ($0.05)", "1/2 cup pizza sauce (for dipping) ($0.48)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF.

Ratatouille, which I discovered as a new bride with Julia Child's 1st cookbook in hand, is one of my summer treats. This version, a traditional tian, or, gratin, since it includes cheese, is no more fiddly than the traditional version of individually diced and sauteed veggies--and much prettier. I love it! I don't think eggplant freezes well, but since the leftovers disappear within a few days, I never tried to freeze them. When I make the more traditional version, I add some chopped Kalamata olives making a dish that's kind of a hybrid between ratatouille and caponata, but that salty bite is delicious with the blander flavors of eggplant and squashes. I don't like this dish \"crispy,\" but I do want it well cooked. \r\n\r\nAfter reading the comments, I suggest that it may take more or less time in the oven than the recipe indicates!

Those reduced priced cuts are perfectly good for cooking within 48 hours, and they tend to fly off the shelves. The regular price for ground chuck at most of my local stores is about $7, ground round at $8, and ground sirloin just under $9. Aldi sells beef chuck roast for $7.99 per lb, and says an average chuck roast is about 2.4 lbs. This recipe makes 8 servings, possibly more, so the cost per serving, even given a slightly higher meat price is still very good and definitely well under what a biria taco costs at a taco truck or Mexican restaurant (cheapest price I saw in my area was 3 tacos for $10.99, 1 for 3.99). A more affordable option is pork, and while pork shoulder is often on sale very inexpensively--like about $2 per lb, The cuts are huge. If you have freezer space, you can get a big one and cut it into 2-3 lb sections--or ask the butcher to do it at the store--and use one of them for this recipe. It will be delicious!\r\n\r\nBeef problems exist in part due to drought in ranching areas in the past several years during which herds were reduced, in part by selling heifers into the beef market, due to high feed costs and relatively low beef prices. During the past several years, demand has increased and prices have jumped, but it takes 2-3 years for a heifer to go from birth to delivering her first calf, and about a year and a half for that calf to come to market. Today ranchers breed heifers at younger ages than my father did years ago but it can be risky for the heifer. Gestation is 9-10 months. While ewes produce 2-3 lambs per breeding cycle with 5 month gestation, cows generally have a single calf. Pigs deliver their first litters at about 1 year, and with gestation under 4 months can produce 2 or more per year of 8-12 piglets, or more, that are ready for market at about 6 months of age, meaning pork is still pretty cheap.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "janmaus"}, "datePublished": "2025-09-30"}], "recipeCategory": ["Main Course"], "recipeCuisine": ["Mexican"], "keywords": "Birria Tacos", "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "servingSize": "1 serving (2 tacos)", "calories": "454 kcal", "carbohydrateContent": "30 g", "proteinContent": "33 g", "fatContent": "24 g", "sodiumContent": "937 mg", "fiberContent": "5 g"}, "@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/birria-tacos/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/birria-tacos/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/birria-tacos/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Budget Bytes", "url": "https://www.budgetbytes.com", "description": "Delicious Recipes Designed for Small Budgets", "atomUrl": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 137898, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2025-09-29T08:30:00-05:00", "modified": "2025-09-19T10:17:10-05:00", "title": "Birria Tacos", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Birria-Tacos-Overhead.jpg", "author": "Jennie Alley", "categories": [{"@id": 10201, "parent": 5632, "slug": "beef-meal-prep", "name": "Beef Meal Prep Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 5632, "slug": "budget-friendly-meal-prep", "name": "Budget Friendly Meal Prep"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 983, "slug": "extra-bytes", "name": "Extra Bytes"}]}, {"@id": 3, "parent": 59, "slug": "beef", "name": "Beef Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 59, "slug": "meat", "name": "Meat Recipes"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10173, "parent": 20, "slug": "slow-cooker-beef", "name": "Beef Slow Cooker Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 20, "slug": "slow-cooker", "name": "Slow Cooker Recipes"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 5632, "parent": 983, "slug": "budget-friendly-meal-prep", "name": "Budget Friendly Meal Prep", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 983, "slug": "extra-bytes", "name": "Extra Bytes"}]}, {"@id": 12975, "parent": 55, "slug": "comfort-food", "name": "Comfort Food Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 1383, "parent": 55, "slug": "dairy-free", "name": "Dairy Free Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 1384, "parent": 55, "slug": "egg-free", "name": "Egg Free Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 60, "parent": 55, "slug": "global", "name": "Globally Inspired Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 59, "parent": 55, "slug": "meat", "name": "Meat Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 55, "parent": 0, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes", "parents": []}, {"@id": 20, "parent": 55, "slug": "slow-cooker", "name": "Slow Cooker Recipes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 10047, "parent": 10046, "slug": "under-3-per-serving", "name": "Under $3 per serving", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 10046, "slug": "cost-per-serving", "name": "Cost Per Serving"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 55, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}], "tags": ["Bay Leaf", "Beef Broth", "Beef Roast", "Chili Powder", "Chipotle Pepper", "Cilantro", "Cinnamon", "Cumin", "Garlic", "Lime", "Monterey Jack", "Onion", "Oregano", "Smoked Paprika", "Tomato Paste", "Tortilla"]}]}]

We'll be going back onto our Keto regimen starting 2morrow and then (after 2weeks) doing the \"Cabbage Soup Diet\" once again for another week.

I use the spices from this recipe, and brown the chicken first (not worry about cooking all the way), then add the bell pepper (I use yellow in this case) and onion (I use white onions because yellow onions are far too large to use a whole one to me, wish the website gave weights for this). I removed the chicken while cooking the pepper and onion then add back in with the uncooked pasta, fire roasted tomatoes, and chicken stock from the cajun recipe and cooked according to that. Mind you, I don't use any of the dairy in either of these recipes, but I find cooking the pasta with at least some broth has a far better result, just pick your preferred spice mix of the two and follow the cajun steps instead lol.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "D"}, "datePublished": "2024-07-28"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "reviewBody": "Hi Beth, Recipe is really good and fast.

FULL RECIPE BELOW \ud83d\udc47 \n\nGet recipe FAQs, substitutions, and a printable version here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/shrimp-alfredo-pasta/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1/2 lb. medium shrimp, peeled and deveined ($4.99)\n1/2 lb. fettuccine ($0.67)\n2 Tbsp butter, divided ($0.20)\n4 cloves garlic, minced ($0.32)\n1 cup heavy cream ($1.00)\n3/4 cup Parmesan* ($1.08)\n1/8 tsp salt (or to taste) ($0.02)\n1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper (or to taste) ($0.02)\n1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional) ($0.10)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. If your shrimp is frozen, thaw and peel before beginning. You can remove the tails or leave the tails on, if you prefer.\n2. Bring a pot of water to a boil for the fettuccine. Once boiling, add the fettuccine and boil until tender (7-10 minutes). Reserve a \u00bd cup of the starchy water before draining the pasta in a colander.\n3. While the fettuccine is boiling, prepare the shrimp and alfredo sauce. Place the peeled shrimp on a cutting board and pat dry with a paper towel. Season the shrimp with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n4. Add 1 tablespoon butter to a large skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, swirl to coat the surface of the skillet with butter. Add the shrimp and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or just until opaque and pink (do not overcook the shrimp). Transfer the cooked shrimp to a clean bowl.\n5. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet along with the minced garlic. Saut\u00e9 the garlic for 1-2 minutes, or just until it is very fragrant but not brown.\n6. Add the heavy cream to the skillet and whisk to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Allow the cream to come up to a simmer.\n7. Whisk the Parmesan into the hot cream until melted. Season the sauce with salt and pepper.\n8. Add the cooked and drained pasta and cooked shrimp back to the skillet with the sauce (make sure to add any liquid from the bowl of shrimp). Toss everything until coated in sauce. If the sauce becomes too thick or dry, add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.\n9. Taste the pasta and add more salt or pepper if needed. Top with chopped fresh parsley and serve!\n\nNOTES\n*This recipe works with both grated or shredded Parmesan.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here. https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:08 Boil Pasta\n0:14 Pat shrimp dry\n0:16 Season shrimp\n0:18 Melt butter and cook shrimp\n0:25 Remove shrimp and add sauce ingredients\n0:30 Whisk sauce\n0:32 Add Parmesan, salt and pepper \n0:41 Add pasta and shrimp\n0:45 Toss and serve", "uploadDate": "2022-06-12T15:00:49+00:00", "duration": "PT1M2S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T-piHLjy_cQ/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-piHLjy_cQ?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-piHLjy_cQ", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["4"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT20M", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeIngredient": ["\u00bd lb. frozen shrimp (or fresh, medium-sized (36/40, peeled and deveined) $6.71)", "\u00bd lb. fettuccine ($0.59)", "2 Tbsp butter (divided, $0.20)", "4  garlic cloves (minced, $0.16)", "1 cup heavy cream ($1.68)", "\u00be cup Parmesan ($1.08*)", "\u215b tsp salt (or to taste, $0.02)", "\u00bc tsp black pepper (freshly cracked, (or to taste) $0.02)", "1 Tbsp fresh parsley (chopped, (optional) $0.10)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If your shrimp is frozen, thaw and peel before beginning.

FULL RECIPE BELOW. \n\nPRINTABLE RECIPE: https://www.budgetbytes.com/honey-mustard-wings/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nBAKED CHICKEN WINGS\n2 lbs. chicken wings or drumettes ($6.97)\n1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)\n1/4 tsp pepper ($0.02)\n1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.02)\n3 Tbsp cornstarch ($0.09)\n\nHONEY MUSTARD SAUCE*\n1/4 cup mayonnaise ($0.40)\n1/2 Tbsp Dijon mustard ($0.05)\n1/2 Tbsp yellow mustard ($0.04)\n1 1/2 Tbsp Honey ($0.18)\n1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar ($0.01)\n1/16 tsp garlic powder ($0.01)\n1/16 tsp paprika ($0.01)\n1/16 tsp salt ($0.01)\n1/8 tsp pepper ($0.01)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil, then place two wire cooling racks over top to elevate the chicken wings.\n2. In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pat the chicken wings dry, then add them to a bowl with the cornstarch mixture, and stir until the chicken wings are coated.\n3. Place the cornstarch coated wings on the prepared baking sheet (on the wire racks). Bake in the oven for 50 minutes, give or take 5 minutes depending on the size of the wings, or until they are light golden brown and the skin is crispy.\n4. While the wings are baking, make the honey mustard sauce. Stir together the mayonnaise, Dijon, yellow mustard, honey, vinegar, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a bowl.\n5. When the chicken wings are finished baking, place them in a clean bowl and pour the honey mustard sauce over top. Stir until the wings are coated. Serve immediately.\n\nNOTES\n*This recipe makes enough honey mustard to coat the chicken wings. If you\u2019d like enough honey mustard sauce to have extra for dipping, like in the photos, I suggest doubling the sauce ingredients.\n\nSee how we calculate recipe costs here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/how-to-calculate-recipe-costs/\n\n\nInstagram: budgetbytes\nFacebook: budgetbytes1\nPinterest: budgetbytes\nTwitter: budget_bytes\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:09 Make seasoned cornstarch\n0:16 Dry chicken wings and coat in cornstarch\n0:21 Bake chicken wings\n0:26 Make honey mustard sauce\n0:41 Toss baked wings in sauce\n0:52 Serve and enjoy!", "uploadDate": "2021-02-06T16:00:11+00:00", "duration": "PT1M1S", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Um-efK0IlHw/hqdefault.jpg", "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Um-efK0IlHw?feature=oembed", "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um-efK0IlHw", "@type": "VideoObject"}, "recipeYield": ["2", "2 5-6 pieces each"], "prepTime": "PT10M", "cookTime": "PT50M", "totalTime": "PT60M", "recipeIngredient": ["2 lbs. chicken wings or drumettes ($6.97)", "1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)", "1/4 tsp pepper ($0.02)", "1/4 tsp garlic powder ($0.02)", "3 Tbsp cornstarch ($0.09)", "1/4 cup mayonnaise ($0.40)", "1/2 Tbsp Dijon mustard ($0.05)", "1/2 Tbsp yellow mustard ($0.04)", "1 1/2 Tbsp Honey ($0.18)", "1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar ($0.01)", "1/16 tsp garlic powder ($0.01)", "1/16 tsp paprika ($0.01)", "1/16 tsp salt ($0.01)", "1/8 tsp pepper ($0.01)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF.
