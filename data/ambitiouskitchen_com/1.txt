These brownies are incredibly rich so you really only need a very small serving.", "url": "https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/fudgy-peanut-butter-swirl-brownies-with-toffee-sea-salt/#wprm-recipe-25070-step-0-6"}], "recipeCategory": ["Brownies", "Dessert"], "keywords": "peanut butter swirl brownies", "@id": "https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/fudgy-peanut-butter-swirl-brownies-with-toffee-sea-salt/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/fudgy-peanut-butter-swirl-brownies-with-toffee-sea-salt/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/fudgy-peanut-butter-swirl-brownies-with-toffee-sea-salt/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Ambitious Kitchen", "url": "https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com", "description": "Inspiring you in and out of the kitchen", "atomUrl": "https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 5169, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2013-02-12T20:31:37-06:00", "modified": "2019-09-25T17:37:00-05:00", "title": "Fudgy Peanut Butter Swirl Brownies with Toffee + Sea Salt", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/10-IMG_8260.jpg", "author": "Monique", "categories": [{"@id": 6976, "parent": 0, "slug": "baking-recipes", "name": "Baking", "parents": []}, {"@id": 5012, "parent": 0, "slug": "brownies-bars", "name": "Brownies + Bars", "parents": []}, {"@id": 5021, "parent": 0, "slug": "chocolate-recipes", "name": "Chocolate", "parents": []}, {"@id": 5027, "parent": 0, "slug": "cooking-method", "name": "Cooking Methods", "parents": []}, {"@id": 4857, "parent": 0, "slug": "dessert", "name": "Dessert", "parents": []}, {"@id": 5024, "parent": 0, "slug": "fall-recipes", "name": "Fall", "parents": []}, {"@id": 4820, "parent": 0, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Food", "parents": []}, {"@id": 7262, "parent": 0, "slug": "freezer-friendly-recipes", "name": "Freezer-Friendly", "parents": []}, {"@id": 5206, "parent": 0, "slug": "indulgent", "name": "Indulgent", "parents": []}, {"@id": 4859, "parent": 0, "slug": "seasonal-recipes", "name": "Seasonal", "parents": []}, {"@id": 6942, "parent": 0, "slug": "valentines-day-recipes", "name": "Valentine's Day", "parents": []}, {"@id": 5025, "parent": 0, "slug": "winter-recipes", "name": "Winter", "parents": []}], "tags": ["king arthur flour brownies", "peanut butter swirl brownies", "Toffee brownies"], "taxonomies": [{"name": "ingredients", "label": "Ingredient", "description": "", "terms": [{"@id": 6921, "name": "Chocolate", "slug": "chocolate"}, {"@id": 6996, "name": "Eggs", "slug": "eggs"}, {"@id": 6997, "name": "Flour", "slug": "flour"}, {"@id": 7021, "name": "Nut Butters", "slug": "nut-butters"}]}, {"name": "mealtypes", "label": "Meal Type", "description": "", "terms": [{"@id": 7051, "name": "Dessert", "slug": "dessert"}]}, {"name": "season", "label": "Season", "description": "", "terms": [{"@id": 7038, "name": "Fall", "slug": "fall"}, {"@id": 7039, "name": "Winter", "slug": "winter"}]}, {"name": "cookingmethods", "label": "Cooking Method", "description": "", "terms": [{"@id": 7042, "name": "Baking", "slug": "baking"}]}]}]}]
