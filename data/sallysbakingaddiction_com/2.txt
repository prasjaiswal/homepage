(Do not roll the doughs directly on the counter because you may have a hard time lifting/transferring them.) Using a lightly floured rolling pin, begin rolling out the vanilla dough. Flip the dough every now and then between rolls to ensure it&#8217;s not sticking to the parchment. Roll out to an 8&#215;14-inch rectangle, and use your hands to ensure the sides are straight and smooth. The thickness will be between 1/8\u20131/4 inch. Set the dough aside, and it&#8217;s most helpful if you refrigerate the vanilla dough at this time. Pick up the vanilla dough using the parchment paper and place the whole thing in the refrigerator as you roll out the chocolate dough. Lightly dust another piece of parchment paper with flour or cocoa powder. Using a lightly floured (or cocoa powder-ed) rolling pin, roll the chocolate dough out to an 8&#215;14-inch rectangle, or very slightly smaller. Remove vanilla dough from the refrigerator. Carefully peel the chocolate dough off the parchment and do your best to line it up on top of the vanilla dough.

They taste exactly like the butter cookies I get from the Italian bakery.\r\n\r\nI love how much detail there is in the instructions. Between the notes, video, and detailed step by step instructions, I was 100% confident I could produce a good result. I followed the recipe verbatim, and did not need to add any additional milk in order to pipe the cookies. \r\n\r\nThe piping was the one aspect of this recipe that had me a little worried. I've never piped anything other than \"happy birthday\", and that wasn't very good lol. The good news is they look perfect! I made one straight cookie as a test to see how the piping felt, then jumped straight into making swirls and stars. I had a few cookies that were a little smaller than the rest, but the shapes were great. Definitely no issues with spreading like some have reported.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for this recipe and all the time you take to produce recipes that make this weekend-baker feel like a pro.

I actually prefer the minis now that I've compared, because whereas the half medium stands taller in the middle of the cookie,  the minis aren't as tall and they're spaced a little apart so they cover more of the cookie surface.  Provides more toasted surface and less gooey marshmallow middle, which I prefer.  I also found that even though some of the marshmallows got toasted more than I wanted, it wasn't noticeable in the finished product.   And on a few where the marshmallows got way too toasted, I plucked them off, replaced and broiled again without over baking the cookies  - couldn't tell the difference.  Such a great recipe!!

I loose most of my muffin to the liner and have to spend a few minutes pulling it off with my nails first. It comes off in streaks, leaving behind some paper scraps. \r\n- The comments about the icing are also very true -- it's incredibly sweet. Honestly, I find the sweetness level complimentary to the muffin, but the texture is *awful*. Using maple syrup makes it a sticky disaster, and I end up having to wash my hands after wrestling the liner off and after eating it. If you don't like sticky hands, 100% switch out the icing for a cinnamon roll glaze or something similar\r\n- And last but not least -- they're honestly quite bland. Like, they're fluffy and the crumb cake portion has a great texture, but the muffin itself is very plain. \r\n\r\nHonestly, I think these are fine as is. They're not stand-out, but they're not awful. With my complaints in mind I would personally make these changes if I were to make them again:\r\n- Double the spices. Absolutely needed to make it less bland\r\n- Switch the icing for a cinnamon roll glaze, or anything remotely similar, just don't use maple syrup. \r\n- I think part of why they stick to the liners is an over-abundance of moisture, so I would either squeeze some of the moisture out of the pumpkin puree first (not all, but some), or add more flour. \r\n\r\nNot the best, but not the worst."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sonia"}, "datePublished": "2025-11-09", "reviewBody": "Delicious muffin!

I used salted Earth Balance in place of butter, But- I used half the suggested amount, and substituted 1 T of toasted hazelnut oil, which is delicious.  I got raw, organic hazelnuts from nuts.com, roasted them at 350 F for 12 minutes.  When they cooled a bit, I put them between two ceramic bowls and shook hard to sluff off the skins.  I did this a couple times.  Then I put them in a thick freezer bag and crushed them first with a rolling pin, then with the flat end of a meat tenderizer.  They are so fragrant this way! Oh, and I also used Nutiva Hazelnut Spread in place of Nutella which I got from Thrive Market, because it is vegan and it does not contain icky palm oil.  They make it in 'regular' and dark.  I used the regular one, because I did not want the chocolate flavor to overpower the hazelnut flavor.  \r\n\r\nThank you Sally for the inspiration!!"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Anna"}, "datePublished": "2021-03-06", "reviewBody": "Amazing and incredibly easy to follow.

Instead, fold the excess dough back over the edge and use your hands to mold the edge into a rim around the pie. Crimp the edges with a fork or use your fingers to flute the edges. (In the pictured pie, I fluted the edges and then crimped them with a fork. Review my how to crimp and flute pie crust tutorial if you need extra help with this step.) If dough is too warm, fluting/crimping will be difficult so you can always chill it in the refrigerator for 5-10 minutes first.

I particularly like the flavour of the orange.\r\n\r\nThis is the second muffin recipe I've made from this site, and both have been so good that I think Tim Horton's might be losing my custom.\r\n\r\nI'm not a good baker, so if I can get this sort of result, then the recipe must be pretty much foolproof.\r\n\r\nThank you Sally"}], "datePublished": "2014-04-04", "@id": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/orange-lemon-poppy-seed-muffins/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/orange-lemon-poppy-seed-muffins/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/orange-lemon-poppy-seed-muffins/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Sally&#039;s Baking", "url": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com", "description": "Trusted Recipes from a Self-Taught Baker", "atomUrl": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 26671, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2014-04-04T08:03:51-04:00", "modified": "2021-04-14T14:42:08-04:00", "title": "Orange Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Orange-Lemon-Poppyseed-Muffins-by-sallysbakingaddiction.com_.jpg", "author": "Sally McKenney", "categories": [{"@id": 58, "parent": 0, "slug": "breakfast-treats", "name": "Breakfast", "parents": []}, {"@id": 419, "parent": 414, "slug": "easter-recipes", "name": "Easter", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 414, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal"}]}, {"@id": 485, "parent": 58, "slug": "muffins", "name": "Muffins", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 58, "slug": "breakfast-treats", "name": "Breakfast"}]}, {"@id": 851, "parent": 720, "slug": "nut-free", "name": "Nut Free", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 720, "slug": "special-diet", "name": "Special Diet"}]}, {"@id": 418, "parent": 414, "slug": "summer-recipes", "name": "Summer", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 414, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal"}]}], "tags": ["all-purpose flour", "brown sugar", "butter", "eggs", "granulated sugar", "lemon juice", "lemon zest", "lemons", "orange juice", "orange zest", "oranges", "poppy seeds", "vanilla extract", "yogurt"]}]}]

If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a \u201cwindowpane test\u201d to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it\u2019s thin enough for light to pass through it.

Also, when simply melting chocolate (without tempering), you may notice a dull appearance and streaks in the chocolate as it sets.

I did the same with these cinnamon \u201ccuffins\u201d as I call them, using almond extract exclusively. The result is a spectral partnership of both flavor and scent. \r\nAs for shape retention, I rolled and stored them in the fridge overnight and baked them at dawn. Before baking I flip them over to keep them uniformly flatter. \r\nCutting the cold rolls was easy and any misshapen casualties were easily re rolled.\r\nAfter removing from oven, I placed them on the cooling rack in my freezer for ten minutes and then iced them.\r\nFor the icing, I added about half C more of 10x to provide more form and white icing color. I wonder, Sally, if one might add a touch of meringue powder to provide more structure instead of adding more 10X? Using a plastic squeeze bottle with a 1 mm opening, I was able to control a nice patterned drizzle. \r\n\r\nThe silicone mats are a housekeeping timesaver, as Sally suggests.

I see where it is not recommended but I have been freezing fruit pie fillings for many years. The trick is -- don't let them completely thaw before putting them in crust.

This year, I decided to make her recipe into cupcakes since we have fewer people coming. I decided to look up a similar cupcake recipe to see about baking time. I'm thrilled to discover that this is almost her exact recipe! Usually she baked everything from scratch, but this recipe she used the pudding and cake mix! Only difference is she used water instead of milk and added 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips to the batter. (She also frosted the cake with whipped cream as opposed to buttercream and decorated it with chocolate turkeys.)

This is  the first recipe I have made of Sally's and it won't be the last."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kati Abbott"}, "datePublished": "2025-10-31", "reviewBody": "This is the most incredible cake I've ever made.
