Try to smash/break up any large chunks. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 9-inch pie dish. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly. Tips: You can use a small flat-bottomed measuring cup to help press down the bottom crust and smooth out the surface, but do not pack down too hard. And run a spoon around the bottom &#8220;corner&#8221; where the edge and bottom meet to help make a rounded crust\u2060\u2014this helps prevent the crust from falling apart.

I used red and blue M&amp;Ms, Almond Joy round candies, almonds, sprinkles, and crumbled Heath bars. They went super fast, and they were fun to make! When I melted all the caramel, the liquid wasn't deep enough to fully \"dunk\" the pretzels, so I poured the melted caramel into a glass measuring cup, and used a spatula to help swirl the caramel onto the pretzels.

Let me just say that even with a little tweak I had to make, these are seriously delicious!  So fudgy and rich.  The tweak I had to make was using 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup peanut butter chips because that's all I had available, but honestly, I love the little bits of melted chocolate along with the yummy peanut butter chips.  I baked in an 8x8 glass dish for 27 minutes.  My boyfriend and I had a couple last night, and they were really good, but I think they are even better this morning!  Yes...

Cupcakes came out awesome. For the frosting, I used Country Crock sticks with avocado oil (7tbsp) and 3tbsp of butter flavored shortening (I would normally never eat the stuff but limited options). Everything else stayed the same. The flavor was really on par with a regular SMBC and had a very similar texture (luscious, creamy, light) BUT it doesn't maintain the structure that real dairy gives. It's a little too soft, but not a recipe ruiner. I can't imagine Florida summers help with that, but it is what it is.

I have no idea how this happened, since I triple checked my measurements and was careful to follow the chilling instructions exactly.... It wasn't disastrous; in fact, the bars were delicious and no one guessed that they were supposed to be cookies, but I am wondering how I can prevent an overly-crumbly dough next time.

I've been quadrupling / x8ing this recipe and making it about once a month for a little over a year now, so I thought I should leave a comment to let everyone know how great it is. I had never made granola bars before this recipe, and after making these, I never went looking for another variation. They are a staple in my diet and cooking schedule.\r\n\r\nFor my *quadrupled* version, I replace the dates and sunflower seeds with:\r\n- 1 cup dried cranberries (this would be 1/4 cup for original recipe)\r\n- 1 cup chocolate chips (this would be 1/4 cup for original recipe)\r\n\r\nSome tips:\r\n- For making these in bulk: Buy the giant bag of almonds and giant bottle of honey at Costco. These bars are basically pure almond, which are expensive unless you can get the bulk discount.\r\n- They freeze well; I regularly store a half-batch in the freezer for about a month at a time.\r\n- Chop the almonds to relatively fine pieces in your food processor or blender if you want your final bars to really stick together (trade-off: the finer the pieces, the more difficult to cut at the end). \r\n- Leave the almonds in bigger pieces if you want to make it easier to stir the final batch, which is the most labor-intensive component of this recipe (trade-off: the bars may not stick together as well).\r\n- As already mentioned, they get sticky if left at room temperature.

After mixing the dough, I place the dough in another bowl to rise, but a greased the bowl first. This helps the dough not stick to the bowl. I mean the whole point of an English muffin is the nooks and crannies. I also did not use wheat flour or bread flour. Both of those are too dense. I want to nooks and crannies. You have to put cornmeal on your silicone mat heavily where you're going to place the dough to rise. If you don't do this, it just sticks even to the silicone mat. Getting my hands sticky so that the cornmeal really stuck to my hands before transferring them to the frying pan was best. Otherwise they just stuck to my hand and it was terrible. I found frying them at a lower temperature on medium. Low was better otherwise they burned but did not get the rise. I also covered them on the frying pan until they rose and then moved the lid halfway for about a minute before taking the whole lid off. And yes, I found using A tiny bit of butter in the bottom of the pan, even with a nonstick pan helped. The first time I did it they started to burn with the Pan being so high before they even had risen.

Blot any excess liquid off the fruit with a clean towel or paper towel. (The wetter the fruit, the more likely the cake could overflow or the topping could seep over the sides when inverted.)

I baked it on Sunday.  It baked perfectly, turned out of the pan no problem, and looked beautiful.  As soon as it was cool and iced, I tasted it.  Well, meh.   The icing was very lemony, but the cake was not.  I am very generous with lemon zest, always adding more than recipe calls for, and even grating extra and putting it in the oven for a few minutes to dry, and then sprinkling it on top of the cake.  I was so disappointed that I didn't even keep the recipe.  But the next day . . . \r\n\r\nI left it on the counter on a rack overnight and covered just the top and sides with clear wrap.  The next day, Monday, I could taste the lemon in the cake a little bit more.  Then I wrapped it properly and put it into the fridge.  Long story short, by Tuesday, the lemon had permeated that cake and it was delicious.  On Tuesday, it was over the top with delicious lemonness, and I was scrambling for the recipe to print up and file with my 5-star, preferred recipes.  Today, Wednesday, it is even better.  Clearly, this is a cake that benefits from wrapping up and putting into a cool place to age for a couple of days before serving.  Whatever you have to do, do it!  Just be warned:  it is LEMONY.

I would request that the recipe includes the weight of the caramels for this reason, in addition to the count number. Also, I suspect that the people who had trouble with the carmel setting up didn't cook it long/hot enough. I let mine boil up a couple of times while stirring as directed. I had no problem with it setting up or sticking to the parchment, and due to the Werther's probably had less caramel than the recipe called for. Don't let it get to \"hard crack\" temperature though.\r\n\r\nI had never melted chocolate in a microwave, and made a mistake, even though I followed the directions. I used chips. I stirred.

I thought about a similar recipe by Nestle prior to making these for their chocolate crumb bars where they only use butter, granulated sugar and flour -NO EGG! Pretty much a shortbread recipe that tastes a whole lot better than this recipe with the 1 egg and egg yolk. I wondered before making how the egg would help the crust. I thought it would be a nice firm, crisp crust. It was not. Also there is not nearly enough sugar in the crust. If I were to make these again I would totally skip the egg and just use the flour, butter and sugar. The baking powder and vanilla extract also really was not needed. As these ingredients did not add any \u201crise or additional flavor. Second, I\u2019d pre bake the crust for at least 15 mins at 350. I would also add MORE sugar to sweeten then mash my berries and cook just a bit to develop the flavor. I\u2019d then allow the crust and filling to cool a bit and then proceed to assemble these again crust dish then bake it for the final product. There wouldn\u2019t be a soggy, tasteless, crust with berries that were barely cooked or sweetened. Now I\u2019m hoping to salvage this by adding the glaze. If not, I\u2019ll have to toss it.

The crust was very thick and I had quite a bit of filling left over after filling the tart to the tippy top. It even overflowed a little bit getting it into the oven. Good thing it was on a cookie sheet! The leftover filling I baked in a buttered cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dish during the last 20 minutes of baking time. Also no vanilla? I added 1/2 tsp. Another issue I have is 1 measly egg isn\u2019t enough to set 1 1/4 C pumpkin pur\u00e9e and 3/4 C heavy cream. I added 1 Tbs cornstarch for insurance but next time I will just use 2 large eggs. The black pepper is a nice touch and I may consider using that in all my pumpkin pies from now on. I always add orange zest to anything pumpkin I bake and I did so here too.

Much easier recipe to use than the oatmeal cups because thick batter is easy to portion out. Almond with skins as a nut flour worked. I increased the flour to 75g* because I added 15ml lemon juice = 1/2 lemon juiced (plus lemon zest, lemon yoghurt). The raw batter wasn't sweet so i added 2tbsp/25g sugar (120g 1 1/4 cups sugar in total using maple syrup and granulated sugar) and the cooked muffins taste lightly sweetened so I'm glad I checked first, because that would have been disappointing! Follow 12 muffins not \"filled to the top\" = 11 muffins with mushroom tops (yes they rose!). 20 minutes cook time was fine. Greasing the tin worked but they're hard to release without cutting into the muffins. Lightbulb moment - grease the tin and use strips of baking paper in a cross to give something to grip.
