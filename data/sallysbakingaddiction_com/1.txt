The reason I reduced the rating is that there was a deep pool of liquid in the bottom of the pie when I cut it to serve it.  When I filled the pie crust, I used a slotted spoon to transfer the mixed filling into the crust to make sure I kept as much liquid out of the crust as possible.

Stick it to your base, adhering it to the side of the house piece. Hold the two in place for a few minutes until the icing is partially set, propping them up as necessary.

I am absolutely amazed at how balanced the flavors are, and that even with the chocolate and toffee they aren't overly sweet at all (and I'm a veggie monster who eats very little sugar ). These cookies are even delicious with nothing on them at all, but I really appreciate how customizable--and easy!--they are. \r\nThank you you again for this opportunity for my kiddo to get more experience and for us to bond. He's feeling very proud of his work and looking forward to gifting these for Christmas to our family, who I'm sure will love them. \r\nTake care \r\nPS \r\nEverything we've made from your site so far has turned out wonderfully.

Oh and I kneaded the bread a lot longer, until I could pull it thin without breaking (windowpane test) so I knew the bread would have a better texture. For the filling portion, I rounded the recipe down to a 180g UK pot and that was a perfect ration of cheese to bread IMO. I used  light cream cheese (same flavour, slightly healthier. In the UK we can only get a Philadelphia spredable and that works no problem), replaced butter for olive oil again, half the garlic granules and 1 1/2tsp herby blend called za'atar (oregano, thyme, sumac (lemon like spice) and salt) which I prefer here over Italian seasoning.

In a large heatproof bowl (preferably with a pour spout), whisk the egg yolks and cornstarch together with a fork. It may not look like it will all come together (it will be dry at first), but keep mixing until the mixture is thick and combined. If it&#8217;s not coming together at all, add a few drops of the milk you need in step 3 to bring together. Set aside at room temperature. Combine the milk and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk until the sugar has dissolved, then bring to a gentle simmer. Remove from heat. Pour the warm milk and sugar mixture in a slow and steady stream into the egg yolk and cornstarch mixture, whisking the entire time. Keep those egg yolks moving so they don\u2019t scramble. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan through a sieve, to strain out any egg yolk solids that may have formed during tempering. Return the saucepan to medium heat, and whisk constantly. The mixture will be frothy on the surface at first, and then it will begin to thicken quickly and large bubbles will begin to burst on the surface. This usually takes about 1\u20132 minutes. Stand back and use caution. Let the bubbles burst for about 20 seconds, or until the mixture has thickened into a custard- or pudding-like consistency. (For a more accurate test, the custard is done when the temperature reaches 185\u2013190\u00b0F (85\u201388\u00b0C).) Remove from heat.

Judging by the ratios and ingredients, it seemed perfect and it is. I set the oven to 360 degrees and used a 1.5qt baking glass pan. The main thing that I did for the conversion was add 3/4 of oat milk at the end of step 2 for the ingredients. I left it in the oven for about 35 minutes. Thinking about adding crushed walnuts next time. Thanks again and this is great!"}], "datePublished": "2018-02-22", "@id": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/coconut-carrot-cake-cupcakes/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/coconut-carrot-cake-cupcakes/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/coconut-carrot-cake-cupcakes/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Sally&#039;s Baking", "url": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com", "description": "Trusted Recipes from a Self-Taught Baker", "atomUrl": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 53234, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2018-02-22T00:00:00-05:00", "modified": "2022-04-04T09:32:04-04:00", "title": "Coconut Carrot Cake Cupcakes", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/coconut-carrot-cupcakes-3.jpg", "author": "Sally McKenney", "categories": [{"@id": 578, "parent": 710, "slug": "cupcakes", "name": "Cupcakes", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 710, "slug": "desserts", "name": "Desserts"}]}, {"@id": 710, "parent": 0, "slug": "desserts", "name": "Desserts", "parents": []}, {"@id": 419, "parent": 414, "slug": "easter-recipes", "name": "Easter", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 414, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal"}]}, {"@id": 851, "parent": 720, "slug": "nut-free", "name": "Nut Free", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 720, "slug": "special-diet", "name": "Special Diet"}]}, {"@id": 414, "parent": 0, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal", "parents": []}, {"@id": 733, "parent": 414, "slug": "spring-recipes", "name": "Spring", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 414, "slug": "seasonal", "name": "Seasonal"}]}, {"@id": 726, "parent": 0, "slug": "video", "name": "Videos", "parents": []}], "tags": ["all-purpose flour", "brown sugar", "butter", "carrots", "cinnamon", "cloves", "coconut", "coconut extract", "confectioners-sugar", "cream cheese", "eggs", "ginger", "nutmeg", "oil", "vanilla extract", "yogurt"]}]}]

I also found that they do not rise as good in the center as they do on the edges because of the frozen raspberries (as you mentioned in the instructions). My recommendation would be to make a jam/filling out of the raspberries that has the seeds removed and, once cooled, spread it over the dough.

I could not find almond extract where I live, but did find pistachio, go figure, and the resulting flavour of my ice cream was spot on the premium gelato I pay through the nose for.\r\n\r\nBefore trying this recipe, I looked at several others and often saw a reference to a \u201ccan\u201d of sweetened condensed milk without saying the amount, so I appreciate that this recipe gave the weight needed because our cans in Mexico are a little smaller. So I got 600g pourable pouch of La Lechera that could be resealed and returned to the fridge for a future batch!.\r\n\r\nSalted pistachios are definitely the way to go as the milk was very sweet. I used a whole bag of Wonderful brand shelled and salted pistachios, which was the recipe amount plus enough to sprinkle on top. I just did regular ol\u2019 Hershey chocolate chips for my ganache, and they melted beautifully, with the climate for once working in my favour, the ganache staying smooth and pourable while I assembled the ice cream. Instead of doing the stovetop method, I heated the cream for one minute in the microwave then stirred in the chocolate chips.\r\n\r\nCream doesn\u2019t whip where I live unless you have a climate controlled kitchen, so my based was very runny, but the end result still had a texture very closed to churned ice cream. I was very surprised. I did use a shallow cake pan rather than a loaf pan as I worried that it wouldn't freeze all the way through otherwise. So this is a very forgiving and easy recipe!\r\n\r\nI have a deep freezer that I keep much colder than the kitchen freezer, so six hours was plenty of freezing time. I know I\u2019m going to be making this ice cream base again a lot with other ingredient combinations, even if I never get the dang cream to whip!"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jenny"}, "datePublished": "2025-07-19", "reviewBody": "Wow!

I am constantly watching what I eat and decided to splurge (as everyone should occasionally) because I have been craving pizza very badly lately. This recipe couldn't have been more perfect. I used a Fleischmann's yeast packet that had been sitting in my pantry for a few months (Since Christmas, I think, and still not expired) and threw all of the ingredients into my bread machine. About an hour and 15 minutes later, I had my dough. It was proofed and ready for rolling. I used the string cheese, as you instructed, and even my husband enjoyed it and he's not a very \"cheesy\" guy. So easy! Easy cleanup too! Found a quick and easy sauce recipe online.

It was truly amazing!\r\n\r\nMany thanks!"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Doug"}, "datePublished": "2020-09-17", "reviewBody": "I found your recipe, looking for a tried and trusted way to stuff pizza crust.\r\nThe only change I made was to cut the string cheese in half, both lengthwise and cross-wise.

Absolutely  the best! Thank you so much for sharing this. I did 2 things differently,  but didn't change any ingredients or the amounts. First, for the dough, I always put the sugar in the milk and butter mix. This gives the sugar a little help in dissolving. Second. I use dental floss to cut the slices from the log. I roll up the dough with sugar, butter and cinnamon mixture to form the log. Then I take about a 12 inch piece of plain dental floss, raise up one end of dough and place the floss under the dough where I want to cut. I will pick up the ends of the floss, one end in each hand, and cross each end simultaneously  over the log and pull tight. This cuts the slice very easily. Repeat this until all of the log is in slices. If you need to, you can mark where you want each slice cut by indenting the dough to make a mark. Again, thank you very much for this recipe.

Also, I made the caramel sauce the day before and warmed it up before adding it to the pie filling. Was it supposed to sit on top of the pear mixture? Mine did not incorporate much into the filling, which made topping with a lattice pie crust a bit difficult because the dough pieces kept sticking to the caramel sauce and tearing apart as I tried to weave the pieces.

SO GOOD!!!! Here's what I did: I had picked some pears and needed to use them up, and they were really hard yet had a lot of flavor and were sweet. This was a benefit, because they kept some texture in the pie; I did not want mealy mushy pear goo in my pie. I actually cooked them down in the juices and sugar mix for about 5 or 10 minutes just to soften them up a bit and release some of the moisture. My mom tried to argue with me to put ALL the juices in the pie, but I followed the recipe, and it was fine (the caramel adds back to the filling so it's not dry at all.) The caramel was actually easy to make (BE CAREFUL), and it really elevates the pie. I wouldn't use just regular caramel here, because the salt balances it out so well. I used her pie crust recipe, too, and it was phenomenal, however I did swap out the vegetable shortening for lard (same amount) because I wanted it to be as old school as possible and lard is cheap! Let me tell yah, it worked like a dream. It was flaky and rich, just delicious. Just keep it all cold and you're good. If you think your dough mix is warming up just pop it into the freezer for 5 minutes while you're washing dishes or something. You can mix it for a bit, let it chill, mix some more, chill it again, etc. Just keep that lard and butter as cold as you can. I dusted the top of the pie crust (the one lining the pan bottom) with tapioca flour just in case it needed any help setting. I had consumed a bit of wine at this point, so I tried the lattice thing and I couldn't get it right, so I just rolled it out and put it on top, crimped the edges, and cut some decorative slits into the top of the pie crust and it worked out just fine! Cheers to all of you who got the lattice thing down, you're better than I am, lol. Another thing to keep in mind: you want to give a pie at least 4 or 5 hours to sit and set after you cook it, so that might be why some of the commenters had issues with runny pies. I will definitely make this pie again, and the salted caramel, and the pie dough! 3 great things came from me making this recipe, so that's really neat.

Hopefully they can be answered by the assistants here.\r\n\r\n1. At 3 Tbsp of batter per crepe (43g per crepe), the batter is enough to make 28 crepes. However the author suggests pouring 3-4 Tbsp of batter per crepe which is a wide range and changes things quite a bit. Since this was my first time making it and I found it challenging to twirl all the batter around a 8\" non-stick skillet, I was only able to squeeze 22 crepes out of the batter as I often found myself using 3.5~ Tbsp per crepe.\r\n\r\n2. After assembling 22 crepes + 22 layers of filling plus a layer of piped whip cream at the top, my cake was still less than 3\" high... how did the author reach 7\" in height? Was there an error in the recipe where we were not provided enough filling? Is the suggested measurement of \"2 heaping tablespoons\" not enough? Because when I tasted the cake, it tasted more crepe-y instead of creamy, and now when I cross reference between different recipes I am seeing pictures where the cream layers are more defined and thicker. Other recipes are calling for 1:1 ratio of crepe to cream/filling, so a 43g crepe should have 43g of cream/filling to match, yet we were only told to put \"2 heaping tablespoons\" which is ~30g at best. Meanwhile my crepes were closer to 50g (3.5 Tbsp) which means i was missing almost double the cream/filling per layer.\r\n\r\nThoughts on my observations?

I weigh out all my  dry ingredients instead of using measuring cups, and just love the fact you list weight measurements in the recipe. I made two small deviations from the recipe, one is that I was a tiny bit short on natural cocoa powder so I added 13 grams of dutch processed cocoa powder to make up the difference, but such a miniscule amount didn't affect the end product at all... also, using a 1A piping tip I piped in the cheesecake filling instead of spooning it in... I think piping it in worked fine, but using that tip I had to go around the pan more than once, so it was a little trickier making sure none touched the sides of the pan, but I managed it just fine. At 53 minutes I pulled the cake out and it was cooked to perfection, but I have a feeling your oven must be quite similar to mine as your cooking times are always spot on for me. All in all I ended up with a cake that looked exactly like the picture and that really was pretty easy to put together. I'm disabled and was able to make this reasonably easily so it's a win on that front.

I put in the 1 tsp vinegar suggested here. I used the milk plus vinegar instead of buttermilk.  I'm sure buttermilk would be a better taste but no one had anything but praise for the end result with milk.   This is a really great cupcake.  I think the irish butter helped the frosting too.  I added the 1 TBS corn starch to the frosting - why wouldn't you want it stiffer?  It was easy to pipe and hold a pyramid shape.  The end result was totally yummy and impressive looking."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Connie G"}, "datePublished": "2022-11-18", "reviewBody": "I have made this recipe a dozen times!

They were more blueberries then cake though which I absolutely adored. It added a nice sour bite. Don't even get me started on the frosting. I thought I had entered heaven. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and added about ten more lemons (I love lemon!) and I thought it was incredible. Light, tangy, and zetsy so fluffy from the whipped. Fantastic!
