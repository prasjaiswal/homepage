Founded in 1921, the BSMGP is the UK's leading organisation dedicated to the art and craft of stained glass. It brings together artists, historians, and conservators to celebrate and preserve this historic tradition while encouraging innovation in contemporary stained glass design.    For this special exhibition, members have crafted a series of 30cm by 30cm stained glass panels, using both traditional and modern techniques. Each piece draws inspiration from the extraordinary legacy of William Morris (1834\u20131896)\u2014a pioneering designer, craftsman, and social thinker. Morris was a key figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, renowned for his intricate patterns, rich use of colour, and commitment to handmade craftsmanship. He described the two leading passions of his life as the desire to create \u2018beautiful things\u2019 and a \u2018hatred of modern civilisation\u2019.    Morris\u2019 influence on stained glass design endures, with many of his principles still guiding artists today. It is hoped that the exhibition will inspire a new generation of people to work with stained glass and commission it for public buildings and homes as William Morris succeeded in doing.    This exhibition of 24 panels showcases a diverse range of artistic interpretations, reflecting Morris\u2019 creativity, social ideals, and intellectual pursuits.    The exhibition is free to enter. All exhibited pieces are available for purchase. The online gallery can be found on the BSMGP website here Exhibition 'Inspired by William Morris' - BSMGP | The home of British Stained Glass    Come and experience the beauty of stained glass in the magnificent setting of Ripon Cathedral.

St Francis dedicated his life to help the poor and preached the interconnectedness of mankind with all of God\u2019s creation. He created the Franciscan Order and is the patron saint of ecologists.    28th February \u2013 A Man of his Word, a 2018 documentary film directed by Wim Wenders.

He says, \u201cThis powerfully moving act, prompted by the humility and self-sacrifice of Jesus doing the same for his disciples, reveals how the nature of Christ\u2019s leadership is still a challenge to all leaders 2,000 years later.\u201d    At the end of this service the altars are stripped.

He started learning the organ under Kerry Beaumont, former organist and chorister at Ripon, when he himself was a chorister at Coventry Cathedral. He was organ scholar at Coventry for a year before going to university, and at Oxford studied music at Pembroke College alongside organ scholarships at Pembroke, and later Harris Manchester College as well. Whilst at Oxford he performed recitals at eight different colleges, including the established organ series at both Exeter and Merton, and worked as an accompanist with the Oxford Opera Society and individual soloists.    As well as organ playing, Alastair is an experienced singer, conductor and pianist. During sixth form he attended the Royal Birmingham Junior Conservatoire to study piano and composition, where he was awarded the Beryl Chempin Prize for his grade 8 piano result and achieved a DipABRSM in piano performance. In his final year at school he conducted a chamber choir and was musical director for a run of the show \u2018We Will Rock You\u2019, and at Oxford he was again musical director for a sellout run of \u2018Guys and Dolls\u2019 at Pembroke College.

Toddy is a retired rural parish priest who first trained as a sculptor and has continued to use the visual arts throughout his ministry and beyond. His creative approach has always sought to open up scripture and invite deeper reflection \u2014 something which lies at the heart of Psalmody.  This book is not a commentary on the Psalms, but a companion to them. In penning a sonnet on each psalm, Toddy has sought to reduce them to a manageable form \u2014 a \u201ctaster\u201d for those who may feel daunted by their scale, but are inevitably drawn to their power. He supplements these with a further fifty-five sonnets, many inspired by seminars he attended in Oxford between 2007 and 2023, exploring wider themes of peace, prayer and spirituality.  Psalmody is intended as a resource for anyone engaging with scripture \u2014 whether for personal devotion, study, or professional ministry. It aims to assure, encourage and inspire, offering a format that can prompt reflection, stimulate prayer and shape spiritual life, as the Psalms once shaped the life and ministry of Christ himself.  We warmly invite you to join us for this special occasion, as Toddy introduces his book, reads from his work, and reflects on how scripture, art and spirituality continue to intersect.  Praise for Psalmody    \u201cFrom decades of living close to farmers, and the clay he molds into sculptures, Toddy knows God\u2019s creation intimately. Now he fashions the psalms into poems of direct, blunt, cries of longing which speak of God\u2019s abiding presence in the chaos of our lives. Both as poetry and spirituality, the psalms speak here afresh as only his rich life could make possible.\u201d    Peter Sedgwick, former principal, St Michael\u2019s College, Llandaff, Wales", "image": "https://riponcathedral.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Henri-Nouwen-Discussion-Evening-1.png", "name": "Book Launch \u2013 Psalmody by Toddy Hoare", "url": "https://riponcathedral.org.uk/events/book-launch-psalmody/?occurrence=2025-09-25"}]

We\u2019re born, we live we die. The Pilgrim course is designed to help you think about that journey in the light of the Christian faith. It unpacks the basic message and teaching of the Christianity and shows you how to pray and how to live like Jesus. It does this in a way that is relaxed, reflective and conversational.    It doesn\u2019t assume any prior knowledge or church going experience. You can be coming to this completely fresh or perhaps revisiting a childhood faith that you would now like to understand a little more. It\u2019s not about finding the right answers, but it is about exploring the faith as it has been revealed in Jesus and lived out in his Church down through the centuries.    Each 6 week course looks at a different ancient text and through reflecting on that in the company of others will help you explore themes of belief, prayer and meaning.    Life is a journey, but it can also be a pilgrimage. Come and make a journey through the great story of the Christian faith \u2013 it might change the perspective of your life; it might also change its direction.

The Beloved Son tells the gripping emotional journey of Henri Nouwen. In a moving solo performance by Andrew Harrison, the play explores hope and longing, family dynamics, sexual and emotional crisis, and the profound insights of a man who became one of the greatest spiritual writers of the 20th century.    Henri Nouwen (1932 \u2013 1996) was a Dutch, Catholic priest, psychologist, and professor who reached the heights of academic success before abandoning everything to join the community of L\u2019Arche, in Toronto. He became part of a life-sharing movement, seeking to make known the gifts of people with intellectual disabilities, exploring their unique talents and creating a welcoming home of friendship and belonging. To some Henri Nouwen put his brilliant career into reverse, risking the loss of reputation, to others his life was a prophetic challenge to church and society.    Price is \u00a312-\u00a314    In preparation for the Festival performance of The Beloved Son, Ripon Cathedral will be hosting two evening discussion groups to explore the life, core themes and writings of Henri Nouwen.

The first part of the concert will feature the popular \u201cChristmas\u201d movements from Handel\u2019s Messiah, followed by a lighter second part of seasonal choral items with audience participation (have your Christmas hat ready). Plus many much-loved carols for everyone to join in!    FAQ    Where is my ticket?  Upon booking you will receive a confirmation email. This email is your ticket and will state the number of seats you have purchased and in which block. A reminder email with any further confirmation details will be sent the week prior to the event.    Do I need to print my ticket?  No \u2013 digital tickets are absolutely fine. Simply show your confirmation email on your phone when you arrive.    Can I reserve a ticket?  No \u2013 we cannot manage reservations over the phone. Please purchase online or via the cathedral shop.    Is there parking nearby?  There are several public car parks within walking distance of the cathedral, including St Marygate and Victoria Grove. Disabled parking spaces are also available close by.
