There will be illustrated talks about items in Ripon Cathedral's rare book collection which is deposited in the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds.        In week one Carol Ballard talks about the C13th illuminated Ripon Bible.       In week two Dr Christopher Tinmouth presents his new research on a cartulary in the collection - a list of deeds - and relates it to historical events and currents.     In week three Carol Ballard talks about a Book of Hours in the collection and what it reveals about late Medieval spirituality.     Lectures begin at 7.30pm.     Alongside this lecture series, we will be holding two parallel exhibitions in the cathedral - one about the Ripon Bible and the Cathedral's rare book collection, the other of contemporary illuminated manuscripts created by children from schools across the area. The exhibitions will be on throughout the month of October so do come and visit. Everyone is welcome!

The first part of the concert will feature the popular \u201cChristmas\u201d movements from Handel\u2019s Messiah, followed by a lighter second part of seasonal choral items with audience participation (have your Christmas hat ready). Plus many much-loved carols for everyone to join in!    FAQ    Where is my ticket?  Upon booking you will receive a confirmation email. This email is your ticket and will state the number of seats you have purchased and in which block. A reminder email with any further confirmation details will be sent the week prior to the event.    Do I need to print my ticket?  No \u2013 digital tickets are absolutely fine. Simply show your confirmation email on your phone when you arrive.    Can I reserve a ticket?  No \u2013 we cannot manage reservations over the phone. Please purchase online or via the cathedral shop.    Is there parking nearby?  There are several public car parks within walking distance of the cathedral, including St Marygate and Victoria Grove. Disabled parking spaces are also available close by.

There will be illustrated talks about items in Ripon Cathedral's rare book collection which is deposited in the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds.        In week one Carol Ballard talks about the C13th illuminated Ripon Bible.       In week two Dr Christopher Tinmouth presents his new research on a cartulary in the collection - a list of deeds - and relates it to historical events and currents.     In week three Carol Ballard talks about a Book of Hours in the collection and what it reveals about late medieval spirituality.     Lectures begin at 7.30pm.     Alongside this lecture series, we will be holding two parallel exhibitions in the cathedral - one about the Ripon Bible and the Cathedral's rare book collection, the other of contemporary illuminated manuscripts created by children from schools across the area. The exhibitions will be on throughout the month of October so do come and visit. Everyone is welcome!

Lewis will also lead a hands-on art workshop in the cathedral grounds (with an indoor option if the weather turns). After a short demonstration in oils, Lewis will move among participants to offer encouragement and tips.    Open to students (GCSE, FE, art projects), hobbyists, and anyone keen to try their hand at drawing or painting the Cathedral.    Bring your own materials, paint in the medium of your choice; easels welcome but not required.    Cost: \u00a315 per person, including refreshments and a short break midway.

The programme includes three 17th century masterpieces: two well known psalm settings by Claudio Monteverdi, Beatus Vir and Dixit Dominus, and Gregorio Allegri\u2019s famous Miserere, composed for the Sistine Chapel.    From the 19th century we perform Robert Pearsall\u2019s haunting setting of Lay a Garland, and Abendlied, a sacred motet by Josef Rheinberger.    Premiered in 1947, and dedicated to the memory of his father, Maurice Durufl\u00e9\u2019s Requiem represents his ideals of peace, faith and hope. Composed amid the terrors of wartime France, Durufl\u00e9 endeavoured \u201cto convey the feelings of human beings faced with their terrifying, inexplicable or comforting fate\u201d. Based on themes from Gregorian plainchant, he created one of the most atmospheric choral masterpieces of the 20th century.    Hertfordshire Chorus is known for commissioning new music, high-quality yet passionate singing, tackling difficult, rarely performed music as well as much-loved and well-known pieces and is one of the UK\u2019s finest symphonic choirs.    Listen to \"spine-tingling Hertfordshire Chorus on our recording of The Armed Man\" here.    Tickets: \u00a325 standard, \u00a320 choral singers and pensioners, \u00a35 school children and students    Please contact the organiser with with regards to accessible seating.    &nbsp;", "image": "https://riponcathedral.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-07-Ripon-square-v4-720x720-1-scaled.jpg", "name": "Hertfordshire Chorus presents Durufl\u00e9 Requiem and four centuries of choral masterpieces", "url": "https://riponcathedral.org.uk/events/durufle-requiem/?occurrence=2024-07-06"}]

What kind of inspiration might we take from William Morris\u2019s art? While his \u2018golden rule\u2019, set out in his pioneering lecture of 1883 \u2018The Beauty of Life\u2019 \u2013 \u2018have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful\u2019 \u2013 may be known to many, Dr Ingrid Hanson suggests that some other, more challenging answers can also be found in that same lecture.    This talk will take in his lectures, his political protest songs and his art, to argue that Morris\u2019s close and lifelong attention to the natural world, its forms, shapes, colours, and interactions, is embedded in his growing understanding of the environment as a \u2018commons\u2019, shared by all, locally, nationally and internationally, so that an art \u2018made by the people and for the people, a joy to the maker and the user\u2019 must also be an art whose practitioners work to extend \u2018beauty of life\u2019 \u2013 equality, freedom from oppressive rule, justice, decent housing, and pleasurable, useful work \u2013  to all.    Ingrid Hanson is a lecturer in English Literature at the University of Manchester. She is author of William Morris and the Uses of Violence (Anthem, 2013) and editor of 21st Century Oxford Authors: William Morris (OUP, 2024), as well as articles and book chapters on Morris\u2019s work and other aspects of nineteenth and early twentieth-century literature and culture. In 2018 she was a guest on R4\u2019s In Our Time and R3\u2019s The Essay, talking about William Morris.    Tickets available here. \u00a310pp including refreshments.    Doors open and refreshments at 6.30pm. Talk at 7pm.    Other Related Events    The 'Inspired by William Morris' Stained Glass Exhibition runs in the cathedral from 23 April to 30 June.

The landings were the beginning of the end of the Second World War and we owe a debt of gratitude to those who served there in order to liberate Europe from the threat of tyranny.  We are also indebted to those who established systems of international rules which \u2013 however imperfectly \u2013 have helped maintain relative peace in Europe for over 75 years since those dark days of 1944 and 1945.  Nicholas Mercer is a powerful and compelling speaker.  He has been there and done it \u2013 a practising Christian Military Lawyer who found himself in the thick of war.  He speaks from first hand experience of how wars begin and are conducted, and of the pressures on the mechanisms which are meant to ensure peace.

He was admitted as a solicitor in 1990 and subsequently commissioned into the Army Legal Service 1991.

The first part of the concert will feature the popular \u201cChristmas\u201d movements from Handel\u2019s Messiah, followed by a lighter second part of seasonal choral items with audience participation (have your Christmas hat ready). Plus many much-loved carols for everyone to join in!    FAQ    Where is my ticket?  Upon booking you will receive a confirmation email. This email is your ticket and will state the number of seats you have purchased and in which block. A reminder email with any further confirmation details will be sent the week prior to the event.    Do I need to print my ticket?  No \u2013 digital tickets are absolutely fine. Simply show your confirmation email on your phone when you arrive.    Can I reserve a ticket?  No \u2013 we cannot manage reservations over the phone. Please purchase online or via the cathedral shop.    Is there parking nearby?  There are several public car parks within walking distance of the cathedral, including St Marygate and Victoria Grove. Disabled parking spaces are also available close by.

The first part of the concert will feature the popular \u201cChristmas\u201d movements from Handel\u2019s Messiah, followed by a lighter second part of seasonal choral items with audience participation (have your Christmas hat ready). Plus many much-loved carols for everyone to join in!    FAQ    Where is my ticket?  Upon booking you will receive a confirmation email. This email is your ticket and will state the number of seats you have purchased and in which block. A reminder email with any further confirmation details will be sent the week prior to the event.    Do I need to print my ticket?  No \u2013 digital tickets are absolutely fine. Simply show your confirmation email on your phone when you arrive.    Can I reserve a ticket?  No \u2013 we cannot manage reservations over the phone. Please purchase online or via the cathedral shop.    Is there parking nearby?  There are several public car parks within walking distance of the cathedral, including St Marygate and Victoria Grove. Disabled parking spaces are also available close by.
