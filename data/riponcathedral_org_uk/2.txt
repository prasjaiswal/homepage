Composed in 1749 by the legendary George Frideric Handel, Solomon unfolds a rich and captivating narrative that is fully 3000 years old. The oratorio paints a vivid portrait of King Solomon\u2019s life, from the opulence of the construction of the Temple to the iconic judgement scene, via the unforgettable visit of the Queen of Sheba. Handel\u2019s genius weaves a story that transcends the intervening millennia, so that although his setting is itself 270 years old, it raises contemporary questions about how a good ruler should behave.", "image": "https://riponcathedral.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ripon-Choral-Society-16-March-2024.jpg", "name": "Ripon Choral Society presents Handel&#8217;s Solomon", "url": "https://riponcathedral.org.uk/events/handels-solomon-with-ripon-choral-society/?occurrence=2024-03-16"}]

The service will be followed by the official launch of Ripon Cathedral Choir Christmas CD.    The choir\u2019s history can be traced back to the time of St Wilfrid, who first introduced singers from Canterbury to Ripon. This tradition continues today with a strong back-row of adult voices and two thriving choirs of girls and boys.    Why is this date important...    Michael, Gabriel and Raphael are the three named biblical angels, depicted as the belov\u00e8d messengers of God. Michael, which means 'who is like God?', is described as protector of Israel and leader of the armies of God and is perhaps best known as the slayer of the dragon in the Revelation to John. He is thus regarded as the protector of Christians from the devil, particularly those at the hour of death. A basilica near Rome was dedicated in the fifth century in honour of Michael on 30 September, beginning with celebrations on the eve of that day, and 29 September is now kept in honour of Michael and all Angels throughout the western Church.

The first part of the concert will feature the popular \u201cChristmas\u201d movements from Handel\u2019s Messiah, followed by a lighter second part of seasonal choral items with audience participation (have your Christmas hat ready). Plus many much-loved carols for everyone to join in!    FAQ    Where is my ticket?  Upon booking you will receive a confirmation email. This email is your ticket and will state the number of seats you have purchased and in which block. A reminder email with any further confirmation details will be sent the week prior to the event.    Do I need to print my ticket?  No \u2013 digital tickets are absolutely fine. Simply show your confirmation email on your phone when you arrive.    Can I reserve a ticket?  No \u2013 we cannot manage reservations over the phone. Please purchase online or via the cathedral shop.    Is there parking nearby?  There are several public car parks within walking distance of the cathedral, including St Marygate and Victoria Grove. Disabled parking spaces are also available close by.    What time do doors open?  Doors usually open at 4.45pm. We are afraid there will be no access to the cathedral beforehand due to rehearsals.    Is the event suitable for children?  Yes! Child tickets (under 16) can be purchased when booking adult tickets.    Can I get a refund or exchange my ticket?  Tickets are non-refundable except in the unlikely event of cancellation.

Led by the Director of Music, Ronny Krippner, this seasonal concert will celebrate Ripon\u2019s musical excellence at this joyful time of the year.    The first part of the concert will feature the popular \u201cChristmas\u201d movements from Handel\u2019s Messiah, followed by a lighter second part of seasonal choral items with audience participation (have your Christmas hat ready). Plus many much-loved carols for everyone to join in!    FAQ    Where is my ticket?  Upon booking you will receive a confirmation email.
