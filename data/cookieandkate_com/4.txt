I tried it tonight with your mac and cheese variation and it was delicious!  I felt much better after eating it than I do after eating the old-fashioned Mac and Cheese.

If your peppers are spicy ones, then you only need two. I had fairly large peppers I bought via Amazon. Two was the PERFECT amount. If you don't like a lot of heat in your food, then stick with two peppers. It was nicely spicy. I used shredded cabbage, avocado, and some plant-based Mexican blend cheese for garnishes. It was a fabulous combination of textures and flavors. I used a pound of Rancho Gordo beans I wasn't sure what to do with. I think many different types of beans would work in this recipe! I looked for a posole recipe in the first place because I had a bag of Rancho Gordo Bean Club posole I wasn't sure what to do with. I may buy it intentionally in the future just to make this soup!

The tomato paste is not overwhelming at all and adds a brightness. The cilantro &amp; lime are perfect. The chili flavor was authentic and robust with a mild to medium spice level.

My go-to breakfast for the last few years is fruit, Greek yogurt and muesli. I was buying my muesli until this recipe showed up in one of your email newsletters about a year ago. I started making it and have never looked back. It is so easy to make and tasty. I do add raisins and chopped dates because I prefer lots of extras! I have made a number of your recipes and haven't hit a bad one yet. Thanks for the effort you put into this."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pat"}, "datePublished": "2025-06-08", "reviewBody": "Oh Kate, I have to admit when this recipe first popped up in my email it took me back 50 years to the first and only time I made muesli.  I was a big fan of oatmeal, and an even bigger fan of hippie era granola, and muesli was touted as the super star of health food breakfasts at the time.  The first bite of pasty soggy raw oats made me swear off the stuff for half a century.  Your idea of toasting all that goodness, well that made it promising enough for me to give it a try.  And boy am I glad I did!  This will now become my go-to summer camping breakfast!  \r\n\r\nA couple of thoughts that others might be interested in:  (1) I could taste salt, and since I use salt to enhance flavors and generally not be a recognizable flavor by itself, I will halve the amount next time.  Obviously this suggestion is subject to individual tastes.  (2) If you like coconut, definitely seek out the large unsweetened flakes.  The grated form doesn't give enough oomph and it tends to sift to the bottom of the batch and burn.  (3) A tip from my gallon-jar granola making days:  bake this in 2 or 3 batches.  You only want a thin layer in your baking sheet at a time so it toasts evenly.  You can quickly develop a feel for when it is evenly toasted by how it feels when you stir it.  It should feel dry and not draggy on the pan when you stir it, but watch it like a hawk the last 2-3 minutes so it doesn't burn.  (4) Another tip from decades of eating oats - when you finish that half-cup serving you will immediately want to go back for more.  Don't!  Raw oats, even if you pour milk over them, will continue to absorb moisture and expand in size in your stomach.  Give it 20 minutes before deciding you really want another serving.\r\n\r\nThanks for another great Cookie &amp; Kate recipe!"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "jennifer felix"}, "datePublished": "2025-06-16", "reviewBody": "Took the Muesli to our family reunion.

For the first part, I took out 3+ min. early (saw some blackening). Flipped, moved to different racks, then set the timer for 10 min. Had about 6-7 min. left, but they looked and smelled done (with more blackening on edges). Would like them crisper yet, but these were very good. For sweet potato fries, I always make a dipping sauce (so good!) \r\nPer person in separate little dishes: a little plain Greek yogurt (maybe 2 tsp), then add in just a little maple syrup (to taste). I have a tiny whisk to mix it up. I never want any other dip with my sweet potato fries! Next time, I'll try to cut them just a tad bigger, and they'll probably cook longer.

I had planned on strawberries, but there weren't any strawberries in the shops... So I bought peaches. I roasted them (just the peaches, without anything else, though as I had a spiced dough) in the oven, pureed them and used that as a filling. When I made it I spent 5 minutes to get all the remainders out of the mixing jar, eating them, because it was so heavenly. And the color was magical as well. When trying a roll today I figured using twice as much filling wouldn't have done any harm either ;-)\r\nThank you for the idea to roast peaches!

You recommend three additive laden brands of Blanco (Casamigos is being sued currently for being so full of junk it's false advertising) and then say this; \"They\u2019re my top brands for all tequila cocktails. Always choose 100 percent agave tequila so you know exactly what you\u2019re buying. Cheaper tequila mixtos contain a blend of alcohols and additives that can contribute to hangovers.\" 100% agave does not mean your tequila does not have additives and coloring and flavor in it, and mixto's are not a blend of additives and alcohols.

I didn't have lime so just left it out &amp; will in future since everyone loved it as is. I also used red onion &amp; about twice as much as the recipe called for. I rarely make a recipe exactly as its written.  My picky eater (major oral sensory issues) who needs protein for insulin intolerance particularly loved them.  I'll probably make a double batch at least once a week for her to have as they're a great source of protein for her.  My husband went to make a taco last night (leftovers from the night before) &amp; was so disappointed that our daughter had eaten the last of the refried beans.  I have 6 cans of pinto beans on my grocery list so that I can make more tomorrow."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John"}, "datePublished": "2025-11-08", "reviewBody": "We truly enjoy the refried beans, burritos!!

Also, unsure whether to turn the heat down from high when the noodles are cooking? My water evaporated a bit too much. Finally, an important note: Use yellow cheese, not white! I think I burned my spices a bit, and then used white sharp cheddar, so it looked the color of baby poo. I added a touch of maple syrup, and both my (very picky) kiddo (6 yo) and my husband liked it.
