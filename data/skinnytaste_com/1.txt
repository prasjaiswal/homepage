My teenage daughter had four tacos and said the recipe should make it into our regular rotation\u2014it definitely will! I really think toasting the tortillas on the stove took these to a whole other level. The main thing I\u2019d do differently is make more corn so there would be more as a side! \r\n\r\nHere are my slight alterations (I don\u2019t think they altered the core of the recipe, thus my rating):\r\n\r\nWe are out of propane so I broiled the steak and \u201cgrilled\u201d the corn on the stove as suggested. Next time I\u2019ll just bake the corn instead. The stove took a long time (it kept making popping noises and I was afraid I was going to get nailed by a flying kernel), and now I have to clean the grate. \r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t have ancho chili powder so I just used regular chili powder. The mayo mixture was a bit runny so I added some of the cotija cheese to help thicken it a bit. \r\n\r\nWe used white corn tortillas.\r\n\r\nThank you! Can\u2019t wait to make these again.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Judy"}, "datePublished": "2024-07-15"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "4"}, "reviewBody": "What would the calorie count change to if you substituted shrimp for the steak?", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebeca"}, "datePublished": "2024-07-13"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "reviewBody": "I've made this twice now and it's delicious!

Note: if your mango has crystalized ice on it because it's been in the freezer too long you want to just scrape it off so it's just the fruit--no ice.)  So thank you for such a delicious dessert.

It's attached to the delicious tender heart, and is also edible. which all remains in the artichoke. Remove the leaves at the base of the artichoke (not edible) Nip off the prickly tops (don't cut, just nip the tips). I do not cut the top. I stick my thumbs into the middle and stretch the opening way open. I stuff the opening &amp; in between the leaves. I drizzy just a little garlic infused extra virgin olive oil over it. \r\n\r\nAdd 1 1/2 cups of water &amp; steam with lid.  Check after 10 to 15 minutes to see if the leaves can be pull out easily. If so, they are done. Under cooking means a tough artichoke. \r\n\r\nDip the meaty bottoms of the leaves into melted herbed butter or plain. As you work your way into the inside you will see the choke. Gently, scrape it out with a spoon. Try not to scrap the heart. Once you clean it up, you can dip the heart &amp; steam into the butter. Yum. The heart and stem are the prize! \r\n\r\nBest time to buy artichokes is March to May. Pick up an artichoke and squeeze it lightly.

Eat them whole, juice them and blend them with coconut etc. Long story short we literally could harvest them. Anyway even our friends used to take a bunch home and always raved about how large and decadently delicious these \u2018king of fruit\u2019 were.\r\nThe largest mango producing country by far is India and many strains of mango originated from the seeds of these fruit, now widely popular and available worldwide.\r\nSkinny taste has taken my all time favorite combo and produced these wickedly \u2018gobsmacking\u2019 Coconut Mango Ice pops. All \u00a0summer long these have been accounting for a lot of space in the freezer at home.\r\nAll I can say is, I hope they never stop producing what\u2019s in my opinion a true classic treat.\r\nThanks and keep em coming. \u00a0 \u00a0 Cheers! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d 5 stars &amp; the Sun \u2600\ufe0f and the Moon \ud83c\udf1d !", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Arun s"}, "datePublished": "2019-10-16"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "reviewBody": "I made these last week, LOVED them and will be making them again soon.

STEAMING!!  Just boil some water in the bottom of a steamer or pot with a steamer basket in it, place the eggs in the basket in a single layer, cover and cook for 15 minutes.  Then plunge the cooked eggs into a bowl of ice water [I use tongs to transfer them].  When cold, lightly crack the shells and they will come off almost in a single piece!  No knicks, no tears, no green yolks -- perfectly cooked.  When I have a dozen to cook, I do them 6 at a time because I don't have a large steamer, but you can cook them in a double layer if you cook them a bit longer, but I haven't tried it yet and can't tell you how much longer that might take.

I blame the wheat pasta, which I find to be the devil\u2019s gluten (sorry sponsors!). Every so often I try it, thinking this time will be different, but it is always a flavor sucking, sawdust meal ruiner. Anyway- some adjustments I would recommend: regular pasta. Deglaze with white wine for some acidity because this meal needs it. Half the beans. Maybe massage the kale with some amino acids to punch up the flavor even more. Instead of pasta water in the pumpkin mixture I would do chicken broth. And perhaps cut the recipe in half the first time so you don\u2019t end up with a casserole dish full of this stuff.

However, it didnt quite do it for me. It wasn't bad, it just tasted like shrimp in soy sauce to me.

If you decide to try, I would recommend grating the ginger so it mixes in better.  Maybe some honey or hoison sauce would have helped thicken and help cut the saltiness. I also made a little bit of rice and included one small spoonful in each wrap to make it a bit heavier and filling.
