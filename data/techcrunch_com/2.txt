And that's great news for Microsoft, as it has been attempting for a few years now to even just steal some buzz from Apple in the MP3 market, if not sales. Well, they've succeeded in the first part, but the second? That could be much more difficult. Microsoft's new device sounds great: OLED screen, HD radio, HD video (720p) outputs, powerful Tegra chip, and most importantly a iPod-beating price of $219.99 for the 16 GB variety, and just $289.99 for the 32 GB version. That latter is a $110 savings over the comparable iPod touch, which the Zune HD clearly targets. And now it has a very real release date: About a month from now, September 15. Are the planets aligning for a hit version of the Zune, finally? Not so fast.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/the-zune-hd-september-15-apple-ipod-event-likely-september-8/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/the-zune-hd-september-15-apple-ipod-event-likely-september-8/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/the-zune-hd-september-15-apple-ipod-event-likely-september-8/#primaryimage", "url": "", "contentUrl": ""}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/the-zune-hd-september-15-apple-ipod-event-likely-september-8/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "The Zune HD: September 15.

Through its website, flyRuby hopes to deliver a quick and efficient way to book private air charter that is comparable to the instantaneous search, booking, and competitive pricing of commercial airline sites, like Orbitz, Kayak and Expedia. The project of founder and CEO Michael Leek, flyRuby owes its technology to CTO Dr. Stephen Smith, who, working in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University, developed the algorithms as part of a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) research initiative to assist the U.S. Air Force. Operating in a similar manner to the technology behind commercial airline booking sites, flyRuby's artificial intelligence instantly scans thousands of flight routes and seating charts for private flights across the country, finding available seating, and streamlining the booking process.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/28/flyruby-aims-to-be-the-kayak-of-private-air-travel/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/28/flyruby-aims-to-be-the-kayak-of-private-air-travel/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/28/flyruby-aims-to-be-the-kayak-of-private-air-travel/#primaryimage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/private_jet_gulfstream_sm8u.jpg", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/private_jet_gulfstream_sm8u.jpg", "width": "500", "height": "340"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/28/flyruby-aims-to-be-the-kayak-of-private-air-travel/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "FlyRuby Aims to Be the Kayak of Private Air Travel"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/673461e7043dd0e6188ec450620d0516", "name": "Rip Empson", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/01b7b7deb60accb4fdc3b8ebf96d0ecf", "url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8810fe67229cee8237adce518195ae80aa36ed7d1e636852a51e47f81818b2ba?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "contentUrl": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8810fe67229cee8237adce518195ae80aa36ed7d1e636852a51e47f81818b2ba?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "caption": "Rip Empson"}, "description": "Rip Empson is a writer, explorer, eager learner and part-time rabble-rouser -- whatever that means.

According to figures out from the International Telecommunication Union, it effectively signifies that Facebook is the world's largest social network by a very long shot. The ITU says in a new report that that the number of people using all social media services have passed the 1 billion mark. That is just 100 million shy of Facebook's usage figure, giving Facebook a 90 percent share of all social networkers. In contrast to the\u00a0very biggest players of all -- Facebook (900m+ users), Twitter (200m+ users) and LinkedIn (120m+\u00a0150m+users) -- the rest of the playing field is heavily localized, with services like QQ in China, Vkontakte in Russia, Mixi in Japan, and Google's Orkut in Brazil, India, and Paraguay among those competing in the space, the ITU notes. The ITU, which is focused on telecoms regulation, flags social media in its report as an area of growing scrutiny for telecoms regulators: not only are social networks becoming more ubiquitous, but services like Facebook are becoming communications mediums in their own right, with voice and text offerings that go head-to-head against similar services from carriers.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/14/itu-there-are-now-over-1-billion-users-of-social-media-worldwide-most-on-mobile/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/14/itu-there-are-now-over-1-billion-users-of-social-media-worldwide-most-on-mobile/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/14/itu-there-are-now-over-1-billion-users-of-social-media-worldwide-most-on-mobile/#primaryimage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/facebook-world-map1.png", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/facebook-world-map1.png", "width": "393", "height": "196"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/14/itu-there-are-now-over-1-billion-users-of-social-media-worldwide-most-on-mobile/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "ITU: There Are Now Over 1 Billion Users Of Social Media Worldwide, Most On Mobile"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/b9e0dcc8b4cb13d8682b387e8534871b", "name": "Ingrid Lunden", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/570c6822b591fe6f73fb3e43f73b027d", "url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4d93c81d35f78998fc6f08aff381f22b0eab1e3035d5cef14ae8df581bb1b0f0?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "contentUrl": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4d93c81d35f78998fc6f08aff381f22b0eab1e3035d5cef14ae8df581bb1b0f0?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "caption": "Ingrid Lunden"}, "description": "Ingrid was a writer and editor for TechCrunch, from February 2012 through May 2025, based out of London.

The app had been in high demand since the day the iPad first launched (Facebook's iPhone app is, after all, among the platform's most popular of all time). But there was no iPad app available on launch day. Nor was there one the day the iPad 2 came out. But that didn't stop people from heading to the app store and typing 'Facebook'. In the mean time, some enterprising entrepreneurs took the opportunity to launch their own, unofficial Facebook iPad apps \u2014 which millions of people wound up downloading. One of these is MyPad (formerly called FacePad), which has seen strong growth since it first launched in January, offering access to Facebook features like Photos, News Feed, and Chat \u2014\u00a0with an interface that's slicker than the web version of the site.

This additional Twitter functionality is to be included in customers' existing plans and won't cost any more aside from standard charges for sending an SMS or MMS outside of any included bundle.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/17/orange-and-twitter-sign-european-partnership-tweets-by-sms-just-the-start-twitter-on-your-tv-could-follow/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/17/orange-and-twitter-sign-european-partnership-tweets-by-sms-just-the-start-twitter-on-your-tv-could-follow/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/17/orange-and-twitter-sign-european-partnership-tweets-by-sms-just-the-start-twitter-on-your-tv-could-follow/#primaryimage", "url": "http://eu.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/twitter-orange.jpg", "contentUrl": "http://eu.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/twitter-orange.jpg"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/17/orange-and-twitter-sign-european-partnership-tweets-by-sms-just-the-start-twitter-on-your-tv-could-follow/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Orange, Twitter sign European partnership &#8211; tweets by SMS just the start, Twitter on TV could follow"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/0ab3e984fb0a25568d53c8555ee4c531", "name": "Steve O'Hear", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/ac0fd2396fbf8e1be148852f3eae6d4c", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Steve-OHear.jpg?w=150", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Steve-OHear.jpg?w=150", "width": 150, "height": 100, "caption": "Steve O'Hear"}, "description": "Steve O\u2019Hear was best known as a technology journalist at TechCrunch, where he focused on European startups, companies and products.

And that's interesting. But here's the thing. I've read this survey over a few times, and I'm still getting nothing out of it. Sure, the company behind the results, ForeSeeResults, wants me to know that Facebook and MySpace rate behind 95% of the other companies they survey (and even 90% of government agencies) according to their index. But what does that mean? That people don't like these social networks? Okay, so what does that mean?
