This new feature, called Communities, will open the service to less formal organizations, and even families. And it also opens the door to B2B collaboration, which is how Yammer seems to be primarily marketing the new feature Communities will launch on March 1. This is a big move for the company. On a conference call this morning, Yammer CEO David Sacks said that one of the problems with Yammer so far has been that communication on the service has been restricted to internal use within a company. The issue many people ran into was that they'd want to collaborate with their clients or business partners as well, but didn't have a way to do that without inviting them to their company's internal network (which often wasn't an option).", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/25/yammer-communities/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/25/yammer-communities/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/25/yammer-communities/#primaryimage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/yammercommunities.png", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/yammercommunities.png", "width": "387", "height": "321"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/25/yammer-communities/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Yammer Communities Open The Door To B2B Microblog Collaboration And Much More"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/bf08c911e2158ce46a560239f8897cf5", "name": "Jason Kincaid", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/93d833fc826146b460b5648bb5a5ebe7", "url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3a9bbd44ce15329de318c0baa563192c265c0efdc337392bc5b6f160c60cedc0?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "contentUrl": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3a9bbd44ce15329de318c0baa563192c265c0efdc337392bc5b6f160c60cedc0?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "caption": "Jason Kincaid"}, "description": "Jason Kincaid is a writer, tech pundit, on-screen video guy, and occasional conference host with ambitions of getting into comedy.

The local chemist that has to place a print ad next to a national chain in the local paper. Globally and every day small businesses destroy their credibility because either they don't have access to professional designers, or the designs they have are simply bad. The current model of having to hire a designer to create good looking visual material in print just does not really work. It's expensive for most small businesses and the average person. And it's slow. At the same time we know that consumers - assaulted daily by great design from companies with huge marketing budgets - now have a have a very high degree of visual literacy. Thus, the concept behind Tweak, as founder Jerry Kennelly puts it, is to \"democratise design\".

No longer is Triggit a consumer facing website editor \u2014 it's now a service that allows advertisers to easily participate in real-time ad exchanges.

In the past we've done hit jobs on email, voicemail and business cards at various times. But there's one thing that bugs me more than all of those things put together - the ubiquitous hand shake. I'm not just talking about the sweaty palms handshake, which sends shudders down my back. I even take issue with the firm and dry handshakes that we engage in every day. I'd like to see the ritual ended. Hand shaking goes back a long, long way. Wikipedia says it was practiced as far back as the 2nd century BC. The story I've always heard is that shaking someone's hand shows that you hold no weapon. Since most people are right handed and would hold a knife in that hand, we shake right hands. Whatever the reason for hand shaking, it isn't needed. Like the Qwerty keyboard (which is designed to slow us down so that the typewriter doesn't jam), it's a relic of an older time that's not only no longer needed but actually causes inefficiency. I can live with the keyboard.

In the Founder Stories video above, Stack Exchange CEO Joel Spolsky talks about the origins of Q&amp;A sites and his competition. Stack Exchange operates Stack Overflow and other peer-reviewed knowledge sites.

Now I have some data to back up my theory. Social media analytics company Sysomos just released some data based on its analysis of over one billion Tweets which shows the contribution of updates by how long people have been on the service. The most active users are those who joined Twitter more than nine months ago.

Before I even understood what was happening, he veered off into the crowd, just another dark head in a dark suit. People around me stared, then looked away and continued their conversation. Generally at events people come up to me to talk about their startups. My reaction varies depending on how much sleep I've gotten and how many times I've been pitched in the previous hour. Sometimes I sit down and watch a demo. Sometimes I give them my card and ask them to contact me. Yesterday I was battling the flu, jetlag and little sleep, and had been battered for three days straight with product pitches from entrepreneurs desperate for press. The event was over and I was on my way back to my hotel. The last thing I wanted was another product pitch as I hurried to the car that would drive me to Davos for the next event. So when I saw this person approach me out of the corner of my eye, I turned away slightly and avoided eye contact. Sometimes that works. But in this case all it did was make me vulnerable to the last thing I expected. In the past I've been grabbed, pulled, shoved and otherwise abused at events, but never spat on.

With Precisionist, Bulova has added a third prong to a standard two prong quartz crystal creating a torsional resonator. This innovation results in eight times the vibration frequency of a traditional quartz watch resulting in the most accurate watch with a continuously sweeping second hand. The aesthetic movement of the second hand becomes the symbol to the consumer of Bulova Precisionist and signals a watch with accuracy so exceptional, you can see it. The technology is accurate to 10 seconds per year as compared to most other quartz watches, which are accurate to fifteen seconds per month. I'm trying to grab a photo, but it's a pretty cool way to get a little more granularity out of a standard quartz movement.
