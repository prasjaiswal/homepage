That's right. Pictures of breast feeding babies are indecent, so they're a no go. But Holocaust denial is totally cool because it fosters open discussion. Facebook wants to \"be a place where people can discuss all kinds of ideas, including controversial ones.\" Even, apparently, the discussion of the idea that someone might be a \"Nigger faggot, Jew nosed cunt.\" That's just one of many hateful messages I found written on a Holocaust denial site on Facebook. Brian Cuban is making the removal of these sites a personal mission. He's arguing the law. He's arguing terms of service. He's arguing common sense and decency.

As we reported last week, PayPal is currently testing the mobile payments and point-of-sale integrations at Home Depot on a friends and family basis, in five stores. Today, we've learned that PayPal is partnering with AJB Software, a company that provides point-of-sale software to large brick and mortar retailers, to integrate the online payments giant's technology into their offerings.

The site provides tools for artists, managers and labels to project manage the business end of being in a band. Things like organising tours, managing fan databases, merchandising and accounting. BandCentral was conceived by founder and CEO Wil Padley, a \"digital creative\" and bass player in the UK band The Domino State.

Anecqdotal evidence is emerging that social networks like Facebook and less conventional startups are perhaps starting to find the chink in the armour of the traditional property listing market here. In particular, Facebook Marketplace is starting to be used by niche poperty agencies like Pimlico Flats, more successfully than the usual online suspects like Craigslist and Gumtree. That latter site has had problems with other aspects of its site like, having to dump dating because of spam and scams. The same problems are plaguing Craigslist in the UK, and this is something that Pimlico Flats picks up on in a blog post on the subject. The ability to verify Facebook users turns out to weed out the scammers. At the same time, although findaproperty and rightmove remain strong, less conventional sites like Globrix, Nestoria, Zoopla (see below) and even niche social networks like Asmallworld are being used.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/is-property-going-social-in-the-uk/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/is-property-going-social-in-the-uk/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/is-property-going-social-in-the-uk/#primaryimage", "url": "http://www.savills.co.uk/residentialsearch/presentation/assets/search/259279/4376933_1_propertyDetails.jpg", "contentUrl": "http://www.savills.co.uk/residentialsearch/presentation/assets/search/259279/4376933_1_propertyDetails.jpg"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/is-property-going-social-in-the-uk/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Is Property Going Social In The UK?"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/2874be5cc43dd5b5b1398f56694f0f60", "name": "Mike Butcher", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/cdf9e3336fb2bf3cb584b8e8123b31cf", "url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/387d52d4f003f16355320cf147bb5be6ec4d0fc8d8057fcae5cb34a89e34f8c2?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "contentUrl": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/387d52d4f003f16355320cf147bb5be6ec4d0fc8d8057fcae5cb34a89e34f8c2?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "caption": "Mike Butcher"}, "description": "Mike Butcher (M.B.E.), formerly Editor-at-large of TechCrunch, has written for UK national newspapers and magazines and been named one of the most influential people in European technology by Wired UK.

It is the new buzzword seemingly taking on a life of its own ala \"SUPER ANGEL\" after this iconic, viral talk by Mike Maples. Ngmoco did it and cashed in big time. Instagram did it and became an app sensation. Twitter did it, and became, well, Twitter. And now Meebo has done it and raised another $25 million from Khosla Ventures to continue building its business. Seth Sternberg, Meebo co-founder and CEO, stopped by our studio after Web 2.0 to tell us about how the site became so much more than Web-based IM and how he says the company is nailing the discovery problem in a new, more powerful way than Digg, StumbleUpon, Delicious and everyone that came before. They reach 180 million uniques world-wide every month. How'd they get there? Moving from a product the founders wanted to build to a product other sites and users wanted them to build, and an emphasis on \"building a product for normal people, not Silicon Valley.\" Sternberg explains what he means in the video below. Tomorrow, we'll be posting part two of our interview with Sternberg where we talk about the value (declining value) of \"reach\" in an age of huge platforms with instant distribution. I also pry a few revenue details out of Sternberg.

After recording (by just pressing Alt+S), you can add a voice over, change the thumbnail preview and include subtitles in the video. The user experience is quite simple and makes creating screencast a very easy task. It works also for creating screencast outside your browser (as long as Screentoaster site is open).", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/screentoaster-launches-new-zero-download-screencast-tool-we-have-invites/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/screentoaster-launches-new-zero-download-screencast-tool-we-have-invites/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/screentoaster-launches-new-zero-download-screencast-tool-we-have-invites/#primaryimage", "url": "http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/6963/26963v1-max-250x250.png", "contentUrl": "http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/6963/26963v1-max-250x250.png"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/screentoaster-launches-new-zero-download-screencast-tool-we-have-invites/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "ScreenToaster launches new zero download screencast tool.

So for instance, companies can upload all their public-facing documents, whether they be company reports, press releases, guidance documents, you name it. Admittedly the slightly dull-but-necessary focus is not going to set the world alight, but with plenty of enterprises still getting their heads around the basics of blogging, RSS and even social networks like Twitter, edocr is a simple way for companies to share their PDFs without being lumped alongside a pirated copy of a Harry Potter novel. New features include an improved design, bulk uploading of documents, an API, document categories, better search and the ability to auto-tweet to a Twitter account when new documents get uploaded. The question is, will that be enough to set it apart from the many players in this field?", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/01/edocr-aims-to-be-a-docstoc-for-corporates-is-that-enough/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/01/edocr-aims-to-be-a-docstoc-for-corporates-is-that-enough/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/01/edocr-aims-to-be-a-docstoc-for-corporates-is-that-enough/#primaryimage", "url": "http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/1369/1369v1-max-250x250.png", "contentUrl": "http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/1369/1369v1-max-250x250.png"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/01/edocr-aims-to-be-a-docstoc-for-corporates-is-that-enough/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Edocr Aims To Be A DocStoc For Corporates &#8211; Is That Enough?"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/2874be5cc43dd5b5b1398f56694f0f60", "name": "Mike Butcher", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/cdf9e3336fb2bf3cb584b8e8123b31cf", "url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/387d52d4f003f16355320cf147bb5be6ec4d0fc8d8057fcae5cb34a89e34f8c2?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "contentUrl": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/387d52d4f003f16355320cf147bb5be6ec4d0fc8d8057fcae5cb34a89e34f8c2?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "caption": "Mike Butcher"}, "description": "Mike Butcher (M.B.E.), formerly Editor-at-large of TechCrunch, has written for UK national newspapers and magazines and been named one of the most influential people in European technology by Wired UK.

Besides browsing, one of the key components that make smartphones as interactive as a computer are the apps that can be used within the device. And it's interesting to consider how we can add this element of computing and interactivity to other gadgets we use in everyday life. Today, Y Combinator-backed startup InPulse is launching its wrist watch, which adds elements of smartphone-like computing to a watch. Founder Eric Migicovsky says that he is a avid cyclist and wanted a way to check his email, SMS messages and calls in a hands free devices. Using a smartphone on his trips didn't make sense because he wasn't able to actually use his hands while cycling. So he started thinking about how he could add smartphone capabilities to a watch, which he always wore when exercising.
