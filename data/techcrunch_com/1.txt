That's in part why usability testing is a no brainer. In fact, there's a bit of a cottage industry around this. Up until now, Usertesting.com had been a bootstrapped business. It emerged over the past five years to attract between 11 and 12,000 customers who use it to record short videos of users testing their products and mobile apps. That roster includes clientele like Home Depot, Sears, Zappos and Dell. Former OpenTable CEO and Andreessen Horowitz general partner Jeff Jordan even raved about the service in a recent post, saying it helped them identify where users were dropping off in finalizing restaurant reservations. So it's little surprise that the company is looking to scale up its business with some additional funding. The company's taking $3 million in financing from San Francisco-based private equity firm Kern Whelan.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/usertesting-3m/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/usertesting-3m/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/usertesting-3m/#primaryimage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-06-at-7-40-32-am.png", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-06-at-7-40-32-am.png", "width": 240, "height": 56}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/usertesting-3m/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "UserTesting Picks Up $3M To Bring Usability Testing To Mobile Apps And Abroad"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/fa763ca80f3c06702d59ddd778842b7d", "name": "Kim-Mai Cutler", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/e0de3cb86f30117e120eb135706c3bfb", "url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "contentUrl": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "caption": "Kim-Mai Cutler"}, "description": "Kim-Mai Cutler is an operating partner for Initialized Capital, an early-stage venture firm and was previously a journalist covering technology, finance and policy issues at TechCrunch -- best-known for her long-form work on the Bay Area.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/author/kim-mai-cutler/"}]}]

Take Wallop, a social-network-turned-social-app company that dove under in September, only to now arise again as Coveroo. Wallop still had some money from the $13 million it raised in 2005 and 2006, but its business wasn't working. It's original idea was to sell virtual \"self expression\" items through its own social network. It ended up creating animated greeting card and party invite apps for Facebook. Rest in peace. CEO Karl Jacob isn't giving up, though. He is just moving in a different direction, away from virtual goods and towards customizing real consumer devices.

The company has hired Googler Adam Sah as its VP of Engineering. Sah is best known for helping invent Google Gadgets, which is used to power many widget-based services like iGoogle and Gmail Gadgets. He later served as a tech lead for Google research, and spent his time before Google at a number of startups. Foodzie helps speciality food vendors get exposure by giving them a central online marketplace to sell their goods. Foodzie takes a cut of each sale, but the vendors are still left with more than they'd get if they sold their goods through traditional speciality food sites. It's been a while since we last heard from the company, but CEO Rob LaFave says that things have been going very well. The site has grown from 25 vendors last December up to 250 this year. In the last 30 days it has seen around 85,000 unique visitors. And, perhaps most importantly, LaFave says that revenue for the site has grown by an order of magnitude in the last thirty days.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/10/foodzie-adam-sah/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/10/foodzie-adam-sah/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/10/foodzie-adam-sah/#primaryimage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/adamsahshot.png", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/adamsahshot.png"}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/10/foodzie-adam-sah/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Foodzie Lands The Man Who Invented Google Gadgets As Its VP Engineering"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/bf08c911e2158ce46a560239f8897cf5", "name": "Jason Kincaid", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/93d833fc826146b460b5648bb5a5ebe7", "url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3a9bbd44ce15329de318c0baa563192c265c0efdc337392bc5b6f160c60cedc0?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "contentUrl": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3a9bbd44ce15329de318c0baa563192c265c0efdc337392bc5b6f160c60cedc0?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "caption": "Jason Kincaid"}, "description": "Jason Kincaid is a writer, tech pundit, on-screen video guy, and occasional conference host with ambitions of getting into comedy.

Now Murdoch is opening up the paper to search engines, although they will only get two lines of each story, thereby ensuring Google is full of ledes but no meat. TechDirt notes that the Times will still be a paid subscription and that the content will still live behind a paywall. However, now that consumers can be made aware of stories behind that wall, in whatever truncated form, perhaps that subscriber number will rise.", "breadcrumb": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/murdoch-finally-invites-the-google-spiders-to-search-london-times/#breadcrumb"}, "inLanguage": "en-US", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "ReadAction", "target": ["https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/murdoch-finally-invites-the-google-spiders-to-search-london-times/"]}]}, {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/murdoch-finally-invites-the-google-spiders-to-search-london-times/#primaryimage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/trapdoor-spider.jpeg", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/trapdoor-spider.jpeg", "width": 400, "height": 362}, {"@type": "BreadcrumbList", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/murdoch-finally-invites-the-google-spiders-to-search-london-times/#breadcrumb", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://techcrunch.com/"}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Murdoch Finally Invites The Google Spiders To Search London Times"}]}, {"@type": "WebSite", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#website", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Startup and Technology News", "publisher": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization"}, "alternateName": "TC", "potentialAction": [{"@type": "SearchAction", "target": {"@type": "EntryPoint", "urlTemplate": "https://techcrunch.com/?s={search_term_string}"}, "query-input": {"@type": "PropertyValueSpecification", "valueRequired": true, "valueName": "search_term_string"}}], "inLanguage": "en-US"}, {"@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#organization", "name": "TechCrunch", "alternateName": "TC", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "contentUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tc-logo-2018-square-reverse2x.png?resize=1200,1200", "width": 1200, "height": 1200, "caption": "TechCrunch"}, "image": {"@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/logo/image/"}, "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/techcrunch", "https://x.com/TechCrunch", "https://mstdn.social/@TechCrunch", "https://bsky.app/profile/techcrunch.com", "https://www.threads.net/@techcrunch"]}, {"@type": "Person", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/29acf7c54fdfa42870e0c8a423c25a47", "name": "John Biggs", "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "inLanguage": "en-US", "@id": "https://techcrunch.com/#/schema/person/image/e0de3cb86f30117e120eb135706c3bfb", "url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "contentUrl": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "caption": "John Biggs"}, "description": "John Biggs is a writer, consultant, programmer, former East Coast Editor and current contributing writer for TechCrunch.

By making the move to competitor Oracle, Hurd gave up options on 346K shares of HP stock which at today's closing price of $39.39 means $13.6M in losses. HP is currently selling at\u00a0$39.39 which marks a steep dip from the day Hurd was fired; On August 6th, 2010 HP's stock price closed at $46.30, a $6.91 difference. If you multiply that by the 2.27B shares outstanding it means a\u00a0$15.68B Hurd-related market cap drop for HP. Clearly not the biggest loser here, and having nearly recovered from last month's particularly messy sexual harassment scandal, Hurd will be joining friend Larry Ellison at Oracle as Co-President.
