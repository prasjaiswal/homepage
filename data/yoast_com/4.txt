User experience, however, is not something you can rate on a 0 to 10 scale. The problematic thing with a lot of these factors is that they're all both direct and indirect ranking factors.

If your user experience is excellent, probably more people are willing to recommend you to their friends, search for you again and go back to your website. All these things tie in together.

So there's a lot of conspiracy theories that they might read your Google Analytics or insights from Chrome, but that\u2019s probably not true. What they are looking at when they visit your site is content, structure, speed, layout, color schemes et cetera. Not only that, but they're also looking for those critical short clicks, bounce backs and pogo-sticking. They do check if people visit five other web sites when they visit this one. They're analyzing their own search results. But it's hard for them to quantify UX because they're not there.

The point is, you need the right amount of content for answering the question that the user has. There\u2019s no answer to how many words a post should need. There's no obvious maximum and more isn't necessarily better but more than enough is a good answer. If you can write 500 words on a topic and that feels right, then definitely don't stop at 200. But in some cases, a short answer is what you want.\u00a0Joost: At some point, I chose to put a minimum word count into Yoast SEO for a reason. I think most algorithms still need a bit of content to be able to determine a topic. If you don\u2019t have enough content, then determining a topic becomes very hard. So don\u2019t get too hung up about an absolute amount.

The weather doesn't impact rankings. That\u2019s true, not directly. But if you sell air-conditioning, people search differently during a heat wave than in regular weather conditions. Now, they're looking for \u201cships today\u201d or \u201cdelivered by tomorrow.\u201d So it's an outside factor. The weather influences the way people click. It changes their behavior and that click behavior can dramatically impact rankings quite quickly. All because of how Google works with these things.

I don't think it ever worked like that. Somehow, there are still people doing it. Maybe it correlates as being a _bad_ ranking factor.

It's a very measurable thing and it\u2019s one of the results of good user experience. Bounce rate is often misunderstood. There's a couple of different things at play here. People search, then click on your website and going back to the search results and click on the next result. They didn't find a result they liked so they bounced back to SERPs. This is called pogo-sticking and I think that is an important thing to look at.It\u2019s also about bounce rate in general, because there might be a certain number of people who come to your site and immediately click away because of whatever it is you have on your site, whether that is a pop-up or you have a horrible design. Fixing your bounce rate by genuinely improving your site is helpful and it will help you regardless of whether your rankings get better.\u00a0Jono: Obviously, there are scenarios where bounce rate is fine. If you have a great article that answers the question the user has they come to read it and go away. That's not a bad experience, because that's what we want to happen. Plus, there's something worth dwelling on here, which is the mental model we all have that somebody searches something and then clicks on a result isn't how people behave. They search than change their search, they search again, they click on five different results and they see all these different brands and all these different pages and it's that experience that decides whether they bounce and how they feel about the experience. That's how we need to be thinking about search and optimizing. It's not just why did they bounce from my site, but what was their experience and what role did I play in it.

Google has confirmed in various publications that site speed affects the ranking position of your site. Now they do say that's only the case when you are very slow, so it only affects a tiny percentage. But site speed is a huge part of user experience. All research says that people prefer fast web sites. So even if site speed isn't a huge ranking factor the experience users have of your site is.

I don't know whether we can answer that with a yes or no. If you\u2019re lucky, your pages get a meta description in the search results underneath the title of your site. If you're lucky, because in a lot of cases Google will show something else. So changing it might not directly impact what's shown there. If it's shown there and it's good, it might influence the CTR from the SERPs to your website.

In this episode, you will get a peek into his world of building businesses, doing marketing without focussing on SEO (!), and the dilemmas he has come across on his journey.
