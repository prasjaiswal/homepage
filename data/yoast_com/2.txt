Reflect on questions such as: What is the main goal of your business or organization? What makes it special? Who exactly are you trying to reach? And what promises do you make on your website? Take your time and literally write down your mission. Once you can answer these questions in detail, you'll have taken the first and most important step in developing your keyword strategy.<br /><br /><strong>What if you're in a competitive market?</strong><br />The market you're in determines whether you'll be able to rank high with your chosen keywords. Some markets are highly competitive, with large companies dominating the search results. Competing with these companies will be hard because they have huge budgets for marketing in general and SEO in particular. <br /><br />If you're launching into a competitive market, your best bet is to start small. Once you \u2018own\u2019 a small part of that niche and become a bigger name in your business area, you could try to level up and sell your cruises to a larger (more general) audience. Your mission will then become more general as well. The scope of your business mission should align with your SEO goals, too. Be realistic about what kind of rankings you can achieve with the size of your business, and focus on what will help you achieve your mission.<br /><br /><strong>An example</strong><br />Let's say you sell cruises to Hawaii. You offer great facilities for children, which makes your cruises especially suitable for parents with younger kids. You will stand out if there are no other family-friendly cruises to Hawaii. This will make your service unique. So it would be smart to make this your mission, your <a href=\"https://yoast.com/how-to-find-your-niche/\">niche</a> \u2014 because this is what you have to offer your audience."}]}, {"@type": "HowToStep", "url": "https://yoast.com/keyword-research-ultimate-guide/#how-to-step-1582643793902", "name": "Make a list of keywords you think people might search for", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "HowToDirection", "text": "The second step is creating a list of your keywords, preferably in a spreadsheet (like Google Sheets or Excel).
