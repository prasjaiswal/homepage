I calculated it out that if you make 12 muffins from the batter they're about 275-325 calories each depending on which substitutions you use. The big calorie kickers are the oil and sugar so if you're looking to cut down on those try replacing half the oil with unsweetened applesauce and/or using some sugar substitute (which I personally dislike because the splenda baking mix gives a funny aftertaste). Also, you don't really need to add the extra salt because Raisin Bran already has  a good amount of sodium.

The prebaking means that when re-launching, it was easy and didn't stick, but I had better success with the crust not burning when I didn't put any olive oil on top and kept it in for only about 35 seconds (obviously adjust per temp). I didnt attempt this, but I have heard that if you lower the temp of the flame while your dough is in and then raise it between pizzas to get the stone nice and hot, you can help harden the bottom without burning the top. But if your goal is to be high protein, I'm not sure this achieves the desired result due to all the added flour. I didnt measure because I added more several times, but I suspect I about doubled the flour to get the desired texture. It still had more of a flatbread-like flavor, but was pretty good overall. I've made a LOT of pizza and I'd put this in the above average category. Not amazing, but pretty good. Our kids seem to really like it, too. Will probably stick to doing it in the regular oven from now on, though, and I will still probably add some extra flour because it was SO STICKY!

I stumbled upon this recipe - and am cooking it now -- but almost didn't because there wasn't really anyone in here who has reviewed it after actually making it.  Pinterest is FULL of those recipes too - all look great in the photos - but then read the reviews, and inevitably you'll find that it needs to be tweaked, etc.  Anyway -- I will post an update on this recipe when it's done.....  (pause)\r\n\r\nMy review:\r\n\r\nTweaks:  \r\n\r\n- I dredged chicken in a mixture of egg (1) and a bit of cream I had on hand THEN dredged in the flour mixture.  It tends to stick better, brown better, and have thicker crust this way (and it will thicken the sauce a bit too).\r\n\r\n- Added a handful of parmesan cheese to the flour mixture for a bit of \"bite\". \r\n\r\n- Used 2-3 tbsp of butter to the oil when I fried the chicken.   Butter is good on everything.  :)\r\n\r\n- I used 3 large chicken breasts\r\n\r\nResult:  A very savory sauce and flavor!  I liked it!  Husband liked it!  College-age son - eh - wasn't his thing, but he didn't dislike it either.  I wouldn't say this is my most favorite chicken recipe, but I would likely make this again.  I was worried that the chicken breasts would dry out since they were pretty big - but they remained moist!  Served it with brown &amp; wild rice - which complimented it perfectly.\r\n\r\nSuggestions:  You're not left with a lot of sauce at the end - I turned down the heat about halfway through noticing the sauce was evaporating quickly.  I would add just a bit more wine and chicken stock if you like a lot of sauce.  :)  For us - it was fine, though.  \r\n\r\nMore bacon wouldn't hurt - :) Maybe another slice or two at most.\r\n\r\nI would also toss something with a bit of kick into the flour next time - maybe a little more parmesan, and definitely a bit more salt.  But you don't want to drown out the herbs - they made the whole house smell wonderful (comfort food).\r\n\r\nVery tasty - and very easy to make.

I bought a 6 cup and 4 cup box of broth and as always it's never what the box says and ended up with 9 cups - turned out to be the perfect amount.\r\n\r\n2. Cut carrots too small so they were kinda too mushy at the end - will cut bigger chunks next time.\r\n\r\n3. I juiced 3 lemons and got 2/3 cup of juice (more then recipe called for but I wanted to adhere to the 3-4 lemon count) - the soup was lemony but I loved it and would used the same amount next time (with 9 cups of broth).\r\n\r\n4. Bought both regular and whole wheat orzo - decided to use the whole wheat and glad I did - great texture and very filling.\r\n\r\n5. BUT I did overcook the orzo a bit - the package said to cook for 9 minutes and recipe called for a few minutes - thought something must be wrong so I could the pasta to the package directions and not the recipe and yes a little overcooked - follow the recipe 4ish minutes probably would've been perfect!\r\n\r\n6. Lastly - don't be afraid of the egg tempering. It's a lot easier then it appears and if you just take it slow, add at least a cup of the hot broth to the eggs (SLOWLY) while whisking constantly, I did about a tablespoon+ at a time - same goes for when you put it all back in the pot you... will be just fine. \r\n\r\nHope these notes help others =)\r\n\r\nIf you love chicken noodle soup AND you love lemon you have to make this soup!

I only say this because I learned an interesting fact a few years ago about why the the vast majority of shrimp sold (and purchased) in stores are shrimps without the heads.  Apparently, if the head is kept on the shrimp for even a couple of hours after it's dead, it will begin to release strong enzymes into the body of the shrimp, which then break down the shrimp flesh and make the shrimp super mushy and yucky, and no one wants that!!! I know this is super irrelevant and unnecessary to respond to a comment a year later, but I figured I would share my knowledge to anyone who wanted to listen lol. Anyways..... thanks for the amazing recipe!!! I was actually also curious where you went in CA that you got these tacos originally, as I live here in So Cal, and just wanted to see if maybe there is a new place I have to go check out for a date night or something =) Thank's again for the great recipe, can't wait to check out more on here =)"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Marion"}, "datePublished": "2017-05-05", "reviewBody": "Terry, I think she did mean remove the tails.

I felt like the sauce lacked something and so I ended up adding about a quarter cup of finely grated Parmesan. That helped to thicken it up and also gave it an extra dimension of flavor and richness. My five year-old absolutely loved it. She asked if we can have leftovers tomorrow, which I think is the ultimate sign of success! I took off a star because it wasn\u2019t quite as quick and easy as I would\u2019ve expected from an SOS recipe. But the flavor, once I added the Parmesan, was absolutely phenomenal.

I don't have a Dutch oven so I wasn't able to broil it (tried to use a flame broiler but it ran out of fuel, haha). It still tasted great despite that and was even better with the bread. As far as fancy recipes go, this one was fairly simple and quick to make. Plan to make it in the future for date nights and company."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sana"}, "datePublished": "2022-03-01", "reviewBody": "Hi!

Super straightforward to make and great flavor combinations. I made some white rice to beef it up a little and to soak up the delicious tomato sauce and it ended up being more like 5-6 servings - the leftovers are delicious as well so I was very happy about that. Per some other comments (and because I was using kosher) I cut down to 1/2-3/4 teaspoon of salt and increased the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon - it ended up being just the right amount of salt &amp; heat for me. The feta I bought came in a 6oz container and even that ended up seeming like a LOT of feta. When I make in the future I will probably use more towards the 4-6oz amount rather than the suggested 8oz. I don't have a grill pan so I just grilled my sourdough in a regular pan with butter - perfect accompaniment for dipping so DON'T SKIP!
