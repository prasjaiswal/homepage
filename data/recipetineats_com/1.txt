Unfortunately, I had two issues..... first, though the base set perfectly, the strawberry topping didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve ended up putting it in the fridge and the edges are certainly firmer now, but the middle of the \u2018slab\u2019 is still quite wobbly if that makes sense. As I said, I loved the taste, but I don\u2019t know why the filling hasn\u2019t set.\r\nOn a different note..... I realise that you have no way of knowing what the skill level of the people who cook your recipes is, so therefore you can\u2019t know how long I, or anyone else, will take to prepare the ingredients. So I assume that the prep time quoted is for what you need to do once everything is sitting in front of you, ready to go. But I wonder if you could remind us of that somewhere in the beginning of your blogs, so that when someone reads in this recipe for eg: \u201cif you have 12 minutes to spare\u201d, they\u2019re not fooled into thinking that\u2019s all the time they need to make these delicious bars before they go in the oven. Frankly, by the time I got everything out of the pantry, measured the ingredients, washed, hulled and chopped the strawberries, prepared the tin, and was THEN ready to bake the bars, close to an hour had passed. And while I had plenty of time and, having cooked quite a few of your recipes now I knew that 15 minutes was unrealistic, I don\u2019t know if everyone would be as happy with that. \r\nI don\u2019t mean to be critical Nagi, I just thought that others might appreciate the hint.

Also known as Parisian Flan, this traditional French custard tart is the most magnificent custard tart in the world (in my humble opinion!). It&#39;s like a giant Portuguese Tart - but better, because there&#39;s so much more custard!The custard is truly incredible - rich, creamy, but not overly sweet. Sets perfectly to cut neat slices but melts in your mouth.DO NOT BE DAUNTED by the lengthy looking instructions. At its core, it is just a puff pastry crust filled with custard. Details are provided to ensure there&#39;s enough information even for less confident bakers.(And PS, it&#39;s SUPPOSED to look rustic!)At its best in the 24 hours after 12 hours refrigeration after finished custard comes out of oven (crispiest base).

The most recent time, I changed the number of freezes to see where that landed me. I assembled the puff pastry in the spring form then froze for about 30-40 min while preparing the custard. I let the custard cool for about 10 min while my oven finished preheating, then assembled and did just the one bake for 65 minutes.

I've made it exactly as written or recently more often (tonight's dinner with fresh peas and shoots from the garden) with an Instant Pot which we bought for our son going away to University but I don't think I can give it up as it is the BEST tool to make risotto hands free, no stirring or watching done in 20 minutes total. On Saute setting saute shrimp put aside, saute garlic and onions until soft, add  then wine until alcohol is burned off, then aroborio, saute until absorbed. Add 3 cups of stock (no milk for us) . Pressure cooking requires less liquid. My rule of thumb 3 cups stock, 1/3 c wine to 1 1/2 cup arborio rice. S&amp;P, close lid, pressure cook on high 5 minutes. Slow release 10 minutes, carefully open, stir in peas, parsley, butter, parmesan salt and pepper to taste. I often also add in finely grated lemon rind.  Great family fave!

I keep making this recipe because its so good..\r\n I also really appreciate having 'Charlie Sauce' in the fridge.  And the trick of softening flank steak with a little soda powder has worked well.  Tonight I tried fresh egg noodles bought at a Chinese grocery and found them a bit oily so I will go back to dried egg noodles.  I also substitued a small cabbage for the broccoli and that wasn't as good.  Maybe big leaved kale would be a  better substitute and I might try that in a few days to use up the noodles and beef remaining.  Thanks for your suggestions and encouragement to substitute  ingredients.

I generally will use an extra tables 2 tbls of this as well as more tahini, roasted sesame oil and a good helping of hot chili and garlic sauce.

There&#39;s no need to add a gazillion ingredients!Workflow - Chop the veg and make the dressing while the pasta is cooking.

A classic, easy cranberry sauce recipe for your turkey centrepiece. Store bought tastes nothing like this homemade version! The touch of lemon zest is what makes that little extra difference.

Was concerned that I might not have enough fats in the filling, so I upped the peanut butter by 10 grams.\r\n\r\n* Brown sugar in the batter, I mixed it in a blender first so it'd be slightly less coarse. \r\n\r\n* Chunks of eating chocolate instead of chocolate chips, since I didn't have any and figured the batter would be dense enough that big chunks wouldn't melt too much. I used about 120g dark chocolate instead of 200g and still ended up super chocolate-y.\r\n\r\nI baked it last night and it was all gone in 18 hours (including the 4 hours it took to cool down fully).

Don&#039;t buy cheap lobster, it&#039;s a total waste of money. Get Moreton Bay bugs instead (it&#039;s so similar, but cheaper) or more prawns instead.

Once I poured the cream in, it was a yellowish colour. I tried keeping the cream and sugar mixture boiling for longer to brown it more, but even on my smallest burner at lowest heat it kept bubbling over the pot and all over the bench.

I doubled the recipe as I was using a kilogram of beef mince but accidentally only added the 375ml of water for Nagi\u2019s standard recipe. I made that up later by adding dry white wine (like a bolognaise) and beer (Coopers Pale Ale). The acids and sugars in the alcohol really helped with breaking down the mince and at the end of approximately three hours cooking with a little extra for reducing the sauce, it was very smooth and didn\u2019t require the blitzing with a blender to get the consistency required. I recommend adding wine and/or beer to this recipe as it adds depth of flavour as well as helps break down the meat.

The possibilities are endless - here&#039;s just a few ideas!While it is simple to make, things can go wrong if made without care. So follow the directions and read the Key Points below.Makes 2 cups / 500 ml - enough to frost 1 layer cake (top and sides), smear onto 12 cupcakes, or sauce for 6 to 8 sundaes.2 layer cakes (filling, sides and top) - double the recipe (click on servings and slide).

I failed miserably with this one, it was my first time using gelatine and I messed up. I did not realise how quickly that stuff sets (I\u2019m awfully slow when following recipes too). So, the gelatine had set completely solid before I dumped it into the mixture, I was beating and beating and beating but the gelatine would not break up and mix in. I cried! I was making this for my fianc\u00e9s birthday and thought I\u2019d have to throw it out and start again, thankfully, I contacted my Mum (Mum normally does the birthday cakes but wasn\u2019t feeling well this time) who advised to use a sieve to separate the chunks of gelatine and salvage the mixture. It worked! I cried again! I managed to finish the recipe and get it into the fridge without any further trouble. The texture was more like a mousse but it wasn\u2019t a sloppy mess like I had expected it would be having been unable to make the gelatine work. Despite my gelatine error\u2026 I am please to say the result was delicious, my fianc\u00e9 and I loved it! My parents were extremely impressed which was lovely. I\u2019ve been quite the basic cook, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to pull off more complicated recipes. Nagi, your blog and recipes have truthfully given me the confidence to learn more and step outside my comfort zone, I don\u2019t even look at the jar or sachet meal bases at the shops anymore!

They are quick to make, easy to share, and the frosting keeps them moist,  Plus, since I like frosting as much as I like cake,  the mini cakes fit the bill perfectly.  What makes this cake so wonderful is the easy preparation (and the easy to follow instructions), the cake\u2019s rich, gentle rather than cloying chocolate flavor, and the creamy chocolate frosting which has a light chocolate flavor.  The mini cakes are light and refreshing, which is unusual for chocolate on chocolate cake.  I also love the wonderful tips you provide.  For instance,  I have trouble frosting cakes.  I love the tip of piping the frosting onto the cake so I can skip the crumb coating, especially on such small cakes.  Also,  from another recipe, you recommend the folded parchment method of lining cake pans\u2014instant and forever hit for me.  In fact, I used that method to fully line a bunt pan ( I simply extended the triangle by 2 inches and fluted the edges by snipping 2-inch slits on the edges.  The Bundt cake slipped out as easily as any other without having to over grease the pan..  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe..  It made me an instant fan of your work.  I have made 3 other recipes from your site (using the cupcake recipe versions to make mini cakes, of course)..  All have been absolutely scrumptious!  P.S. I love your inclusion of Dozer.
