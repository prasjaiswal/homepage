I could not find won ton wrappers, so used egg roll wrappers, brushed on a bit of oil, salted them, then used a pizza cutter to cut them to size. They came out perfect!

It is my favorite fall soup recipe, and I look forward to making it every year! By the time the weather warms up my family is probably sick of it! :) A couple little changes I make that we enjoy: I add a whole can of pumpkin puree at the end (since it is just likely a mix of winter squashes anyway, it doesn't alter the flavor much, and it thickens the soup nicely and deepens the color). I also use different herbs according to our preference (cilantro is not a favorite, but I love sage and parsley or basil). And the fresh naan bread really amps this up! Go with her suggestion and make it! It's not hard, and her recipe for naan bread is great. I make a lot of bread, and that's still my favorite!

I'm picky about herbs and spices so I only put a small amount of sage, and skipped the oregano and chili flakes. I also didn't have rigatoni, so I used rotini and just mixed the pasta and the sauce together in the pasta pot and dumped it into the springform pan (the lazy way!). This was really yummy and I'm guessing that it will taste really great after sitting for a night in the fridge, too.

I added a few things to it to beef it up, and made a substitution so I didn't have to run to the market. \r\n\r\nFirstly, I subbed the shallot for one small onion and a few cloves of garlic as I find it's helpful when I am out of shallots.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these are the additions I made to make more of this awesome recipe to feed my family... I cleaned up 2.5lbs of chicken tenderloins and pounded them out to an even thickness. Salt, pepper, garlic powder - then lightly dredged them in flour before searing them in a pan with butter. Removed from pan and added about a pound and a half of sliced baby bellas with the onion and garlic, scraping up the brown bits from the chicken. Towards the end I added the rosemary and thyme, right before deglazing the pan with a solid helping of pinot grigio. Reduced to about half, tasted it and added salt and pepper as needed - I didn't add cayenne because my kids are sensitive to spice - but they ate this up! I add the chicken back to the pan then start adding the gnocchi.\r\n\r\nThe gnocchi came together so nicely. I made a double batch and froze the second (going to use it for a thanksgiving side dish, so thank you). I boiled them just as you suggested, added them to the sauce once they floated to the top and added some of the water with a ladle several times as needed to thin/make more of the sauce to make sure everything was nicely coated. It made a huge batch! And it made excellent leftovers for the next few days. Adding pecorino romano at the end with even a little balsamic glaze as a drizzle was FANTASTIC! \r\n\r\nThank you so much for sharing recipes like this. They have inspired so many of the meals I've made for my family over the last 3 years. I've learned a lot from them! I appreciate how accessible they are and how much thought you put into your instructions. You make it so literally, ANYONE can cook! I love your flavor-brain and the love you put into everything.

It was very tasty, but the sauce wasn't very saucy, so I added an additional can of crushed tomatoes.\r\n- The total time on the recipe is listed as 30 min cooking and 30 min prep.

It also cooks up just as deliciously with olive oil only (if you\u2019re trying to be healthier).

I\u2019ve made it a few times and it\u2019s a big hit, even with my 4-y/o. I\u2019ve always made it in a medium soup pot - tonight was the first time I did it in an actual large soup pot as called for, and I strongly suggest you do it in a smaller pot. You want something significantly taller than it is wide. The soup cooks for a long time at a boil after you put the broth in: 15 mins, then 20 mins for the two sets of dumplings. Even covered, you lose a lot of liquid, and everything starts burning on the bottom of the pot. I had to add three cups of water, and there wasn\u2019t really enough liquid to poach the dumplings. It still came out, but it\u2019s worked much better for me in a narrower, deeper pot. Great recipe, though. Lots of depth of flavor and love the dumpling texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin"}, "datePublished": "2024-02-04"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "reviewBody": "I questioned this about half way through the dumpling process but I kept going and boy was it worth it!!

The 10 minutes of sitting in the hot skillet off heat are probably sufficient for young, tender, heritage kale but were insufficient to achieve a palatable texture for the kale that I used.  With all of the other flavors, I can't justify the extra cost of using young, tender, heritage kale here.  If using mature, tougher kale I will deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup of fruity white wine or a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and a couple of tablespoons of water when I remove the squash; then cook the kale in that liquid (covered) for 5-10 minutes, until barely tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Trill"}, "datePublished": "2019-08-21"}], "recipeCategory": ["Main Course"], "recipeCuisine": ["Italian"], "keywords": "lasagna", "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "servingSize": "6 g", "calories": "617 kcal", "carbohydrateContent": "69 g", "proteinContent": "26 g", "fatContent": "26 g", "saturatedFatContent": "14 g", "cholesterolContent": "66 mg", "sodiumContent": "766 mg", "fiberContent": "3 g", "sugarContent": "9 g"}, "@id": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/simple-caramelized-butternut-squash-kale-florentine-lasagna/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/simple-caramelized-butternut-squash-kale-florentine-lasagna/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/simple-caramelized-butternut-squash-kale-florentine-lasagna/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Half Baked Harvest", "url": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com", "description": "Made with Love", "atomUrl": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 23972, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2014-11-03T02:00:00-07:00", "modified": "2025-10-20T12:04:15-06:00", "title": "Simple Caramelized Butternut Squash and Kale Florentine Lasagna.", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Simple-Caramelized-Butternut-Squash-and-Kale-Florentine-Lasagna-1.jpg", "author": "Tieghan Gerard", "categories": [{"@id": 38, "parent": 12745, "slug": "main-course", "name": "Main Course", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12745, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 13, "parent": 38, "slug": "pasta", "name": "Pasta", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 38, "slug": "main-course", "name": "Main Course"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12745, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 82, "parent": 12748, "slug": "vegetarian", "name": "Vegetarian", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12748, "slug": "diet-specific", "name": "Diet-Specific"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}], "tags": ["blue cheese", "Butternut Squash", "casserole", "cheese", "christmas", "dinner", "entertaining", "family", "fontina", "friends", "gatherings", "kale", "Make Ahead", "Pasta", "thanksgiving", "winter squash"]}]}]

I'm sure it would've been a bit more intense had I not had to troubleshoot some things. Don't be afraid to pile on that streusel, it's simple but excellent!\r\n\r\nThat being said, I did run into some issue. As soon as I saw two minutes of browning butter, I kinda didn't believe it at all. I've never browned butter in two minutes. Maybe I've always had subpar stoves or pans. Two minutes of cooking the butter was not enough time to even get a light browning. Definitely had to let it sit a bit before I could smell the nuttiness and see a light browning. \r\n\r\nEven after that, a light browning of the butter still left way too much moisture in the dough to be scoopable; it's like cake batter. I had to add a good amount of extra flour until I got a consistency that I could reasonably scoop. All that added flour left me with a very cakey cookie. A good cakey cookie, but not what this recipe was going for. \r\n\r\nMaybe I'm just a terrible judge of browning? What I think might've been a cause too is your website's metric conversion of measurements. I prefer to weigh ingredients and followed what your converter said. The numbers were a little too precise to have been entered by you, so I assume there's some default not calculations being used? I don't know. \r\n\r\nI would like to try them again at some point because a buttery gooey version of this flavor profile sounds divine.

I also used spinach instead of arugula and threw my lemon zest in that mixture rather than rubbing it on the fish (just because I forgot).

In a medium bowl, combine the pumpkin, fontina, blue cheese (if using), sage, nutmeg, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. 5. To assemble, spoon 3/4 of the Bolognese sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Working with one pasta shell at a time, spoon about 1 tablespoon of the pumpkin cheese mix into each shell, placing the filled shell into the baking dish as you go. Spoon the remaining Bolognese sauce over top of the shells. Add the provolone. 6. Transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake 20-25 minutes or until the cheese has melted and is lightly browned on top. Serve topped with fresh oregano.", "url": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/pumpkin-cheese-stuffed-pasta-bolognese-bake/#wprm-recipe-95954-step-0-0"}], "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": "4.19", "ratingCount": "436", "reviewCount": "6"}, "review": [{"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "reviewBody": "This was fun to prepare and the flavor combination was to die for.

I served it over red lentil pasta that was mixed with zucchini zoodles.  Below are a few of my other adjustments to lighten this recipe\r\n1. Used 1 TBLS oil to saute chicken\r\n2. Used 1 TBLS butter\r\n3. Blended cottage cheese 1/2 cup for the cream\r\n4. I feel it would be better to mix in cream and artichokes before placing the chicken back in the pan\r\n5.

Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.4. Punch the dough down and roll out onto a lightly floured surface, creating a large rectangle about 12 x 18 inches. Spread the butter evenly over the dough. Sprinkle on the apples and cinnamon sugar. Starting with the long edge closest to you, roll the dough into a log, keeping it tight as you go. When you reach the edge, pinch along the edge to seal.\u00a0Using a sharp knife, cut into 12-15 rolls. Place the rolls into the prepared baking dish.\u00a0Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 20-30 minutes.5. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F.\u00a0Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown.6. Meanwhile, make the icing. Add the butter to a pot set over medium heat. Allow the butter to brown lightly until it smells toasted, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat. To a bowl with the cream cheese in it, whisk in the maple syrup, powdered sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Spread the icing over the warm rolls.

First of all, we loved the soup \u2013 it was absolutely delicious! About the prep time, since you list ingredients as already having been chopped, shredded, cubed, etc., are you not including the time to prepare them in the prep time? I ask because IMO it would take far longer than 15 minutes for most people to chop the bacon, onion, garlic, broccoli, potato and chilies, plus get the kernels off 4 corn cobs, shred 3 cups of cheese and slice the green onions (it took me over an hour). And since it takes about 15 minutes (the stated prep time) to cook the bacon, onion and garlic, it dawned on me that maybe you weren\u2019t including preparing all the ingredients in your prep time.

Also, it was too runny and the yellow just dumped into it instead of sitting on top, so for the second serving, I put it in the freezer to make it more solid so I could take a pretty picture of it.  The yellow was very runny, too.  And once I started drinking it, I realized the coconut meat was now small chunks.
