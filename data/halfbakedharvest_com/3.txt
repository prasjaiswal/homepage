It felt like I was eating a breakfast muffin with strawberries and whipped cream.  I prefer a true shortcake.  The recipe instructions left out the cinnamon.  I added it where it should have gone.  I would have liked it better without it.  It made it feel even more like a breakfast muffin.  The recipe came in as making 16 muffins with the ability to adjust.  I was able to get 12 medium sized muffins from the recipe set for 16.  I would need to use mini muffins to get 16 instead of a standard size.  This would be great as a breakfast dish in place of French toast or pancakes with fruit and whip.

Pulled everything off the bone and let it cool a couple more hours which helped. The gravy wasn't as rich in flavor as we had hoped. The amount of onions was overpowering and just too much. And we even cut back on the amount of onion from what the ingredients said. We did add some au jus to the gravy to give it more flavor which really helped. If I make this again, I would definitely use a roast and would add a lot less onion. We had it the next night for leftovers and it was probably even better than the first night!

Hopefully, it'll freeze up okay and I'm sure it'll taste delicious, but I don't think it was really necessary to use 6 cups of blackberries (which cost about $30) for this recipe. To create the desired swirl look I'm guessing 2c of berries would be sufficient. I'm not sure if anyone else had this issue but figured I'd share.

Easy, relatively quick and tasty.  It used up a goodly amount of my plethora of cherry tomatoes including some of my partially \"sun dried\" older ones deliciously.  I used ricotta because I had an open container I needed to use.  But feel clarifications are needed to recommend to others:\r\n\r\n1) How much prosciutto?  I thought it was 5 slices.  I bought it at a local Italian Market and they naturally wanted a weight  which would have helped.  I guessed at the thickness. Thankfully I didn't get 8.  On top of my 9\" diameter sauce pot I had to layer them.  The top was crispy and delicious but the middle were not as crispy and of course the bottom one a little soggy.  I was thinking when I read the recipe that it was a single layer.   \r\n\r\n2) In my sauce pan (sloped sides) the sauce was not that deep (and yet I had to layer the prosciutto) so I had to hold the pain 45 degrees to adequately submerge the immersion blender.  If I had used a roasting pan the prosciutto would have been a single layer perhaps but the sauce would have been way to shallow for the immersion blender. \r\n\r\n3) The directions have measurements for the parmesan cheese and basil and say to add to the sauce after blending.  But then later it says to put on top of the pasta.  Should the amount in the directions be divided? Or should more be prepared for on top.\r\n\r\n4) Least troublesome but a common issue with shallots and garlic cloves.  What size shallot?  Some are about 1 1/2 \" and some are 5\" long.  I went for the larger ones since they were stewing and I love shallots.\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Teri L Vieth"}, "datePublished": "2025-08-26"}], "recipeCategory": ["Main Course"], "recipeCuisine": ["American", "Italian"], "suitableForDiet": ["https://schema.org/VegetarianDiet"], "keywords": "cozy, under one hour", "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": "582 kcal", "servingSize": "1 serving"}, "@id": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/sungold-tomato-pasta/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/sungold-tomato-pasta/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/sungold-tomato-pasta/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Half Baked Harvest", "url": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com", "description": "Made with Love", "atomUrl": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 184542, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2025-07-07T01:00:00-06:00", "modified": "2025-10-02T14:21:14-06:00", "title": "Simple Roasted Sungold Cherry Tomato Pasta.", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Simple-Roasted-Sungold-Tomato-Pasta-1-scaled.jpg", "author": "Tieghan Gerard", "categories": [{"@id": 12761, "parent": 12746, "slug": "american", "name": "American", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12746, "slug": "cuisine-inspiration", "name": "Cuisine + Inspiration"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12746, "parent": 4, "slug": "cuisine-inspiration", "name": "Cuisine + Inspiration", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12748, "parent": 4, "slug": "diet-specific", "name": "Diet-Specific", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12747, "parent": 4, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12759, "parent": 12746, "slug": "italian", "name": "Italian", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12746, "slug": "cuisine-inspiration", "name": "Cuisine + Inspiration"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 38, "parent": 12745, "slug": "main-course", "name": "Main Course", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12745, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12767, "parent": 52782, "slug": "one-pot", "name": "One Pot", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 52782, "slug": "by-method", "name": "By Method"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 13, "parent": 38, "slug": "pasta", "name": "Pasta", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 38, "slug": "main-course", "name": "Main Course"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12745, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 4, "parent": 0, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes", "parents": []}, {"@id": 12750, "parent": 12747, "slug": "spring", "name": "Spring", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12747, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12752, "parent": 12747, "slug": "summer", "name": "Summer", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12747, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12745, "parent": 4, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 82, "parent": 12748, "slug": "vegetarian", "name": "Vegetarian", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12748, "slug": "diet-specific", "name": "Diet-Specific"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}]}]}]

I have also left out the poblano peppers for no reason other than I forgot to buy them at the store, and I think that the flavor is all there without them. \r\n\r\nOne thing that I have done twice now is to make this a day before we want it for dinner.  I store the chicken and the rice in the same container, which allows all of the flavors to come together and for the rice to absorb all of those flavors.  It is fantastic this way.  \r\n\r\nGreat recipe that I will continue to use for years to come.

So, no mango or cilantro, an adobo hot sauce on the side for the spice lovers, and they were made kinda like little quesadillas since I had some nice fresh 4-inch flour tortillas from the Mexican market down the road.  Personally, I preferred topped mine with plain sour cream and a drizzle of the hot sauce, though the garlic lime sauce was tasty too.  SO DELICIOUS!!

Loved the bread crumb topping.  The sauce had the best flavor.  Were the rinds supposed to melt into the sauce?

We wouldn't do it shredded if we did it again.  I needed to have chunks of chicken or leave the breast whole and melt the cheese onto each one, then sprinkle the breadcrumbs onto the top when you serve a whole chicken for each person.  That would probably be how I make it again because I felt like the sauce ended up overtaken and it was my favorite part.

(But you never place back in and removing is unnecessary.)  I think you meant \r\nremove the herb stems?  2) this recipe is kinda a lot diff than the video. In this instance, I see the IG video is more relevant than the written one here on your blog.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU for entertaining my comments.
