I always read reviews, but attempt to make a recipe exactly as written the 1st time, *but,* as an *experienced* home cook, sometimes I choose to add more of an ingredient, as I did with this one.\r\nI love shrooms but shitakes are expensive. Therefore, I used one, 8oz, container of sliced button shrooms -most stems removed - and about 1.25-1.5oz shitakes, then removed the stems (this recipe doesn't specify this, but it *should* bc they're tough &amp; inedible) then sliced. *Tbh, I'm not sure purchasing shitake shrooms is worth the cost for this recipe bc it's hard to distinguish the flavor of the shrooms in the broth, along w/the other flavors.*\r\nTo veggify the recipe a bit more I added more bok choy. I couldn't find the baby variety, so I bought reg sized bok choy &amp; used the amt I wanted, which equates to approximately 1.5 reg/med sized stalks, AND 1 med carrot, thinly sliced. \r\nI like more broth, so I used 2 (32oz) cartons of *low* sodium chicken broth (2 cups more than recipe indicates). This is *critical,* both if u are sensitive to salt, and bc u can control the salinity more if u use low/reduced/no salt added broth. \r\nU can always add more salt, but u can NOT take it away later. And, bc this soup uses soy sauce, u DEF don't want to think about adding salt until u taste it, after the last steps.\r\nOn that note, *always* use LOW sodium soy sauce bc, again, u can always add more salt later, but u can't take it away.\r\nLastly, bc of my budget restrictions, I couldn't afford to purchase toasted sesame oil on top of the bottle of regular sesame oil I needed for this recipe. Therefore, I didn't make the chili oil garnish (I read several reviews stating they didn't add this and it was good, despite that, and it was!).\r\nI'm certain this soup could *only* be *better* with the chili oil garnish, *BUT,* it's yummy without it.\r\nSo, hopefully my thorough review helps folks who want to healthily a recipe by adding more veggies, as well as those on a budget who may need to eliminate an ingredient/garnish and still end up eith a great dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Natalie"}, "datePublished": "2024-10-20"}], "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": "327 kcal", "servingSize": "1 serving"}, "@id": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wonton-soup/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wonton-soup/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wonton-soup/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Half Baked Harvest", "url": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com", "description": "Made with Love", "atomUrl": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 100674, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2021-01-13T02:00:53-07:00", "modified": "2025-10-13T11:11:25-06:00", "title": "25 Minute Wonton Soup with Sesame Chili Oil.", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/25-Minute-Wonton-Soup-with-Sesame-Chili-Oil-1.jpg", "author": "Tieghan Gerard", "categories": [{"@id": 14243, "parent": 12746, "slug": "asian", "name": "Asian", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12746, "slug": "cuisine-inspiration", "name": "Cuisine + Inspiration"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12746, "parent": 4, "slug": "cuisine-inspiration", "name": "Cuisine + Inspiration", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12748, "parent": 4, "slug": "diet-specific", "name": "Diet-Specific", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 13234, "parent": 12748, "slug": "healthy-ish", "name": "Healthy-ish", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12748, "slug": "diet-specific", "name": "Diet-Specific"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12747, "parent": 4, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 38, "parent": 12745, "slug": "main-course", "name": "Main Course", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12745, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12767, "parent": 52782, "slug": "one-pot", "name": "One Pot", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 52782, "slug": "by-method", "name": "By Method"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12766, "parent": 52782, "slug": "quick-easy", "name": "Quick + Easy", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 52782, "slug": "by-method", "name": "By Method"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 4, "parent": 0, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes", "parents": []}, {"@id": 97, "parent": 12745, "slug": "soups", "name": "Soups", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12745, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12745, "parent": 4, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 684, "parent": 12748, "slug": "vegan-recipes", "name": "Vegan", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12748, "slug": "diet-specific", "name": "Diet-Specific"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 82, "parent": 12748, "slug": "vegetarian", "name": "Vegetarian", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12748, "slug": "diet-specific", "name": "Diet-Specific"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12751, "parent": 12747, "slug": "winter", "name": "Winter", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12747, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}], "tags": ["asian", "Chinese", "dinner", "Easy", "heathy", "quick", "simple", "Soup", "wonton"]}]}]

Finally did so today. A couple of modifications: I used two cups of coconut milk and 1 cup full fat yogurt. Delicious. Dehydrated strawberries are hard to find and very expensive so I used strawberry drink crystals from the bulk store which worked well. My only warning is you have to work quickly after you apply the white chocolate coating as it freezes almost immediately upon contact with the frozen bars making it difficult for the fruity/crunchy coating to stick. Also this was my first time using silicone molds. I found pushing from the bottom was a much easier way to get the bars out.

I agree with other reivewers on how unstuffed they looked even when filling with correct amount and not overstuffing, filling still oozed out. Also took way more time in the oven then 10 minutes each side. I think it wound up being close to 20 each side. Flavor was great, just the time it took is way understated and appearance looks nothing like the picture. They are flat.

Do not overstuff these with ingredients.\" I followed that exactly and even looking at her photo on this recipe page, I can see she must have definitely put more of the shredded cheese/herb mixture than 1 tablespoon as I literally used a tablespoon to scoop the mixture and that is much less than what is shown in the photo (which I didn't have following the printed recipe). I didn't think it looked like enough, but followed it with the instructions not to overstuff. Unfortunately, they really lacked flavor and seemed way understuffed using the instructions provided. The bite basically tasted like mostly plain egg roll and too much egg roll to the ratio of the ingredients inside. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you are using two sheet pans to make the quantity in this recipe, make sure you place them far enough apart on the racks in your oven, or better yet, maybe even bake them completely separately.

Here are some struggles, though: the cake layers are quite soft and didn't hold up well; the trees melted immediately, even after being in the freezer for a long time; the spiders aren't as cute or distinguishable without the eyes (I couldn't find any); all of the layers of things on the cake make for a very sweet cake.

A couple tricks I learned:\r\n\r\nIf using a tart pan then the two cups of pretzels is just enough to cover it. If using a traditional pie plate I add another half cup to cup of pretzels and tbsp or two of butter to the crust recipe. \r\n\r\nFor the chocolate I melt the coconut oil before heating everything up and use way more than what is called for. When the chocolate mixture is glossy and thin is the time to act. You gotta move fast. Coat the bottom of the crust but good luck with the sides, I still haven\u2019t mastered it. Honestly the crust isn\u2019t the star of the show on most pies so it\u2019s fine with just the bottom coat. \r\n\r\nEverything from there is a breeze. I top mine with swirls of chocolate sauce and serve with whipped cream on the side. The filling really tasted like the inside of a Reese\u2019s pieces. Sooo delicious. \r\n\r\nThe best thing about this recipe is that there is always some filling left over. My husband uses it on his pancakes, in shakes or with chocolate for a sweet treat. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let some of the stuffy reviews deter you - this pie is delicious and worth the effort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laura"}, "datePublished": "2023-01-22"}], "nutrition": {"@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": "617 kcal", "servingSize": "1 serving"}, "@id": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/chocolate-peanut-butter-pie/#recipe", "isPartOf": {"@id": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/chocolate-peanut-butter-pie/#article"}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/chocolate-peanut-butter-pie/"}]}, {"@context": "https://slickstream.com", "@graph": [{"@type": "Plugin", "version": "3.0.1"}, {"@type": "Site", "name": "Half Baked Harvest", "url": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com", "description": "Made with Love", "atomUrl": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/feed/atom/", "rtl": false}, {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": 103477, "isFront": false, "isHome": false, "isCategory": false, "isTag": false, "isSingular": true, "date": "2021-03-23T02:00:18-06:00", "modified": "2025-09-15T10:28:12-06:00", "title": "Vintage Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie.", "pageType": "post", "postType": "post", "featured_image": "https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vintage-Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Pie-1.jpg", "author": "Tieghan Gerard", "categories": [{"@id": 12761, "parent": 12746, "slug": "american", "name": "American", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12746, "slug": "cuisine-inspiration", "name": "Cuisine + Inspiration"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12755, "parent": 12747, "slug": "back-to-school", "name": "Back to School", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12747, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12746, "parent": 4, "slug": "cuisine-inspiration", "name": "Cuisine + Inspiration", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 5, "parent": 12745, "slug": "desserts", "name": "Desserts", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12745, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12749, "parent": 12747, "slug": "fall", "name": "Fall", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12747, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12747, "parent": 4, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 51455, "parent": 12747, "slug": "mothers-day-recipes", "name": "Mother's Day", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12747, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 522, "parent": 5, "slug": "pie", "name": "Pie", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 5, "slug": "desserts", "name": "Desserts"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12745, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 4, "parent": 0, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes", "parents": []}, {"@id": 12750, "parent": 12747, "slug": "spring", "name": "Spring", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12747, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12752, "parent": 12747, "slug": "summer", "name": "Summer", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 12747, "slug": "holidays-seasonal", "name": "Holidays + Seasonal"}, {"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}, {"@id": 12745, "parent": 4, "slug": "type-of-meal", "name": "Type of Meal", "parents": [{"@type": "CategoryParent", "@id": 4, "slug": "recipes", "name": "Recipes"}]}], "tags": ["Chocolate", "Dessert", "easter", "Easy", "mothers day", "Peanut Butter", "pie", "quick", "simple", "spring", "summer"]}]}]

The pretzels do not stick well--when processed they have two consistencies: chunks too big to adhere to egg-coated chicken and pretzel dust that's more like flour than bread crumbs. I double-dipped them to try to make them crunchy, which was time-consuming and messy. I still think they were much less crunchy than potato chips, corn flakes, or even bread crumbs.

It's outstanding, but after reading the written recipe first, there's no way it would cook in the time specified. The actual cooking time was 15 minutes for a 2-inch-thick salmon fillet. The video shows the salmon being cooked in a preheated cast-iron pan first, then the sauce poured over it. That could work, but the fish would have a different texture\u2014more steak-like than the silky-smooth poached style described in the written version. So, if you want to make it: preheat your cast-iron skillet on medium. Lower your oven rack to one level below the top and preheat your broiler. Make the sauce, then pour it into the pan and bring to a boil. Add the salmon, skin side down. Cook, depending on thickness, for a few minutes. Turn and cook, skin side up, until almost done. Place under the broiler until the sauce bubbles like jam and the skin is crispy and beautiful.

No amount of cookie sheet banging could flatten them, even though I used 1 3/4 cups of flour and tried banging the sheet at different intervals from 3-6 minutes. For the second batch, I removed after five minutes &amp; pressed down on the center of the cookies with a medium-sized wooden spoon before returning to the oven for another 2-3 minutes to finish. Worked perfectly. I did sift the flour before adding to the recipe, and I'm wondering if maybe that had been a mistake? While it may be cheating, the \"smoosh the middle\" approach makes them look very much like the photos. EVERYBODY loves these and it's now my go-to cookie.\r\n\r\nThree tips: \r\n1) For those who are hate white chocolate -- bad white chocolate is the worst, but great white chocolate is amazing. You don't need a lot here. Buy a fancy bar of white chocolate at Whole Foods or some other decent shop &amp; you won't be sorry. It really makes the cookie distinctive.\r\n2) I would add another 1/2 cup of crushed Oreos to the batter. It may be gilding the lilly, but dang if the cookie-in-a-cookie approach isn't genius.\r\n3) The only place you're likely to find malt powder in Amazon. 12 ounces of King Arthur brand, is $10.

Add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until just combined. 4. Spoon half the batter into the prepared bread pan. Dollop teaspoon size amounts of the cream cheese over the batter. Gently swirl the cream cheese using a sharp paring knife. Arrange the apples in an even layer over the cream cheese. Sprinkle with half the cinnamon sugar, then evenly spoon the remaining batter over the apples. It&#39;s OK if the batter doesn&#39;t fully cover the apples. Sprinkle over the remaining cinnamon sugar.5. Bake for 55-65 minutes, or until the center is just set. I usually cover my bread halfway through baking to prevent burning. 6. Meanwhile, make the honey butter. In a bowl, combine the butter, honey, and a pinch of salt.7.

The recipe lists two instances of sugar and butter.

I was only able to guess which butter to use when because it says \"whisk in the butter\" at one point and one part of the butter is supposed to be molten, but that is again only at the second mention of adding butter. There are multiple points where things go in the oven but the temperature is only given once - it worked out with the same temperature twice but again, I had to guess and interpret the recipe, when especially baking recipes should be clear instructions.

One of my favorite things about Half Baked Harvest recipes is that they are designed in such a way that they are easily modified to suit your family.

Bring 6 cups of water and about 1/4 cup salt to a boil in a large pot. It seems like a lot of salt, it&#039;s not, trust me. 2. Rinse the rise under water. Once the water is boiling, add the rice, and stir. Cook, stirring occasionally until al dente, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain into a sieve and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. 3. In a bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of the rice with the yogurt. 4. Melt together the butter and oil in a 10-inch skillet set over medium heat. When the butter melts, add the yogurt coated rice and level it out with the back of your spoon. Pile the remaining rice into the pan, mounding it toward the center. Using the handle of a wooden spoon, gently dig 5-6 holes into the rice down to the bottom of the skillet. There should be enough oil in the pan so that you can see it bubbling up the sides. Add oil if needed. 5. Cook the rice over medium heat, turning the pan a quarter turn every 5 minutes to ensure even browning. Cook until you start to see a golden crust begin to form at the sides of the pan, about 15 minutes. Then reduce the heat to low and continue cooking another 15 to 20 minutes. The edges of the crust should be golden, 35-40 minutes total. 6. Meanwhile, make the chickpeas. Heat a large, high sided skillet over medium heat. Add the oil, chickpeas, garlic, shallots, turmeric, paprika, a pinch of red pepper flakes, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until the chickpeas are crisped all over, about 8-10 minutes. Add the sesame seeds and greens, tossing to combine. Cook 2 minutes, until toasted, remove from the heat. 7. Run a spatula along the edges of the pan to release the rice.

I followed your directions and Food52\u2019s video exactly, outstanding!!!! I think my only change would be to add a bit less salt to the rice and I added pomegranates at the end on top of the rice.  I would definitely add a lot of pomegranate seeds to cut the salt. With the chickpeas and spinach it was perfect!!! I wonder is there a sauce to make with the Persian rice???
