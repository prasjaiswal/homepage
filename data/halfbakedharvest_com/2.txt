They turned out looking very pretzel-y, and tasting even better. If anything, they came out of the oven a little on the flat side.\r\n\r\nHonest take on the total time required for the bagel-making process: the recipe says 2h 45 min total, but both times it took me a little under 5 hours. There were a few factors that influenced this: first, the single recipe quantity yielded more like 15-20 bagels for me instead of 10-12 (I didn\u2019t want them to be monstrous, and was hoping to fit around 8 per baking sheet). Second, these additional bagels meant I had to batch them. I wasn\u2019t baking with a convection oven and I needed to do three batches, which likely added an hour to the process.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the 2h 45 min total time is a little far-fetched, even with these factors removed: \r\nSteps 1 &amp; 2: 2 hours (0.5 hours for prep &amp; mixing, and assuming we leave dough to rise for 1.5 hours)\r\nStep 3: 30 mins (15 for making dough balls, 15 for dough rising)\r\nStep 4: 20 mins (assuming 12 bagels, boiling 3 at a time)\r\nStep 5:  40 mins (assuming 1 batch; 10 + 15 + 15 for brushing with egg, transfers &amp; cooling)\r\n\r\nTotal: 3h 30 min\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s probably at a minimum. If you need to batch the recipe, you can probably tack on another 15-20 minutes per batch. Hopefully this is helpful feedback! Thanks again for making available this well-loved recipe.

I prefer to make this dish when I\u2019m cooking other things in the kitchen so I don\u2019t mind hovering to stir the sauce periodically. It is important to cook off most of the liquid to avoid soggy tacos. These freeze incredibly well.

I love your website! So I was waiting on my meringue cookies to cool in the oven for 30 minutes before putting the cake tins in the oven. Since I was making the batter while the meringues were cooking, I ended up needing to leave the batter in the tins for about 30 minutes before putting them in the oven at 350 F (while the meringues finished). The batter rose a little, but nothing major. I greased the tins with both butter and vegetable oil (and probably used a bit too much, but when I cooked my layers for another 3-layer cake last week, I hadn't put enough oil in to keep the layers from sticking and crumbling a bit when I took them out) and put them in for 350 F. The excess oil and butter made the sides a little burnt/crispy. It wasn't a big deal, as I was able to just easily trim the edges. However, the inside of the cake is moist, but turned from a nice white cake to the color of a gingerbread cake and tastes a bit off. Any idea why this happened??

Add whatever herbs you use in the turkey, a tbs of maple syrup (or more if you prefer sweet) a dollop of milk or cream (I use half n half) and top with a pecan crumble before baking. Adventurous?

My muffin tin was a little small to accommodate the uncooked diameter of the rounds so I made them and stacked them on a baking sheet.

I usually break this process down between two days, slicing takes about 20 to 30 minutes depending on how many sweet potatoes you\u2019re using and at least 1-2 people helping it takes 1-2 hours to stack the slices in two muffin trays. The only way that this would take 20 minutes for prep time is if I had at least 6 people helping. I love your recipes, but girl there is no one I trust less regarding whether something is easy, simple or fast \ud83d\ude02 but it is always delicious!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rachel"}, "datePublished": "2025-11-25"}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "reviewBody": "I made them last year for Thanksgiving and making them again as they were delicious. \r\n\r\nThis time I am not hosting but making them again.

A few things....I was confused by the description in the post calling out old fashioned rolled oats but quick oats being listed in the ingredients. I went with the old fashioned oats. Here's where I think things could create problems....shredded vs finely shredded coconut....I used finely shredded because that's what I had, but I don't think just regular shredded would work as well. Here's the major part.............THE PEACHES!!!!!!! My peaches were VERY ripe and therefore VERY juicy. Once they were baked (which took quite a bit longer than stated in the recipe to get golden, but they did eventually!) they were still quite sticky and didn't want to hold together. I attribute this to my peaches being so juicy. Next time, if my \"dough\" is still that wet, I'll be sure to add a bit more crushed pretzels and rolled oats to get the \"dough\" to be a more firm consistency. I also would just put a few pieces of pretzel on the top and not the whole. It was difficult to get the pretzel to break when taking a bite of the cookie, so having pieces will make it easier to eat.

We doubled the corn flake mixture since we double dredged our chicken. We also added corn starch to our chicken before dredging. We both recommend the double dredging and adding the corn starch. Another change we did was add half a lime juice and extra hot sauce to the bang bang sauce. Four our hot sauce, we used sriracha. Both the addition of lime juice and extra hot sauce really brighten the sauce up. \r\n\r\nAnother note is do not skip the step of adding oil to your chicken before baking. We almost skipped it because we thought it was silly at first, but the oil really helps crisp the chicken up.

I didn't have mustard seeds but Trader Joes Whole Grain Dijon is basically just mustard seeds so problem solved.

I didn\u2019t need to add any extra water or cooking time, so I wonder if others were using a vessel that didn\u2019t conduct heat as well. Just a guess.

Fold in the chocolate chips and 2/3 rds of the cinnamon chunks. 5. Spread the dough into the prepared dish. Press the remaining cinnamon chunks into the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over. Bake for 20-22 minutes, until the edges are just setting and the center is still doughy. Let cool6.

I especially loved the addition of the bread. My only issue was that the chicken didn\u2019t quite fit in the pan with the onions in step 4.

I used the recommended amount of chicken and a large cast iron pan, but maybe I missed something. To work around this, I removed the chicken and cooked it separately while continuing to stir the onions. Then, I added the chicken back in at step 6 before topping it with cheese.

It was rich and creamy and while the sweet potatoes cover any trace of the fishiness, the fish sauce adds a umami flavor that sends this dish over the top. The curry paste loaded with basil is another layer of flavor. The crispy shallots added texture to the creaminess. I served it over half jasmine rice and half quinoa.

One of the first recipes I made was the creamy chicken gnocchi soup with mushrooms. This more creamy version also sounds wonderful and would like to try next with heavy cream.  I am making in advance for lunch tomorrow for family. I made a chicken broth in advance and shredded the chicken for this recipe. Now, do you recommend I add the gnocchi and spinach in the day of and cream? Not sure if it will get too thick over night? When I made the mushroom version, we enjoyed it even more the second day as it was even more flavorful and rich, (used whole milk) I also left some but not all of the gnocchi in when refrigerating and liked how gnocchi absorbed more flavor.

I substitute celery for leeks and the flavor is much better in my opinion (I\u2019m not a big celery gal though). \r\n3. Keeping the butter in the skillet after searing the chicken, I saut\u00e9 the shallots and leeks first before putting that in the crockpot.\r\n4.

I have all HBH cookbooks and love the on-line recipes (great index--thanks!) as well.  I love the layers of flavors you incorporate into your recipes.

The cauliflower had clearly soaked up some of the chicken juices, lemon, and heavy cream. They taste amazing. I will definitely make this again!!  It\u2019s a hit with my three boys, too.
